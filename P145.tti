OL,6, There is an expanding group of people, 
OL,7, brought together on social media, who  
OL,8, share a common interest in the medium  
OL,9, of teletext.                           
OL,11, Some are retro-technology enthusiasts, 
OL,12, others artists who enjoy the challenge 
OL,13, of the limited palette and resolution. 
OL,15, A growing sub-group are amateur digital
OL,16, archaeologists, who, like TVARK, aim to
OL,17, preserve the decades of content trapped
OL,18, as a time capsule on old video tapes.  
OL,20, There are even occasional meet-ups that
OL,21, go by the nameFTeletext Block Party.

OL,6, The progenitor of the "teletext scene" 
OL,7, is arguablyFCarl Attrill,Gwho set up a 
OL,8, Facebook group in 2015 which now has   
OL,9, over a thousand members.               
OL,11, Another key figure isFPeter Kwan,Gthe  
OL,12, creator of the community-run "Teefax"  
OL,13, service, andFAlistair BuxtonGwhose vhs-
OL,14, teletext software enables the recovery 
OL,15, of long lost teletext pages from the   
OL,16, degraded signals captured on regular   
OL,17, domestic video recordings.             
OL,19, Alistair also wrote the raspi-teletext 
OL,20, tool which generates a teletext signal 
OL,21, for a real TV using a Raspberry Pi.
