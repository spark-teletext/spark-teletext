OL,6, As weird and as plain screwed up as it 
OL,7, might seem, dear reader, I've always   
OL,8, felt a bizarre affinity towards the    
OL,9, technically still current ITV franchise
OL,10, holder for the South East, and not just
OL,11, owing to the fact that the South East  
OL,12, is where I live. I know, I know,       
OL,13, Meridian were no Granada in terms of   
OL,14, programme output, but my friends, what 
OL,15, a logo they had back in the day. What a
OL,16, logo indeed.                           
OL,18, Not a simple logo by any stretch, not  
OL,19, the sort of thing that would work as a 
OL,20, tiny app icon (as the 1999 ITV generic 
OL,21, look excruciatingly demonstrated), but 
OL,22, recognisable without a doubt.

OL,6, And my word did it do untold damage to 
OL,7, my psyche as a kid. I remember staying 
OL,8, at my Grandma's one night and the      
OL,9, Meridian logo suddenly appearing at the
OL,10, end of some programme on the TV. Being 
OL,11, very young, I was frightened to death  
OL,12, by it. So much so that I had trouble   
OL,13, sleeping that night, and that in the   
OL,14, future whenever I was given the choice 
OL,15, of staying overnight at my Nan's house 
OL,16, or at Grandma's, for several years     
OL,17, afterwards I always chose Nan's without
OL,18, fail, resolute in my fear that that    
OL,19, intrusive and unnerving face of fire   
OL,20, was waiting at Grandma's to sneak into 
OL,21, my hastily prepared bedroom and petrify
OL,22, my soul.

OL,6, You may think that this is a bad thing,
OL,7, but I look back on those days fondly.  
OL,8, For a logo to have such a strong impact
OL,9, despite it only being on screen for a  
OL,10, few seconds is no mean feat.           
OL,12, In addition, I think children should be
OL,13, frightened more often by the TV that   
OL,14, they're spoon-fed, as it's good        
OL,15, character building and it worked in the
OL,16, 70s.                                   
OL,18, But having just seen Meridian's        
OL,19, inaugural broadcast, I now have an     
OL,20, unfortunate suspicion that the sunburst
OL,21, logo was the only good thing about     
OL,22, Meridian besides Dinenage and Thrower.

OL,9, still be likeable and make his actions

OL,11, someone who's as cynical about people

OL,14, Debbie Thrower, meanwhile, shows

OL,16, even when demonstrating why it is never

OL,8, sum up their legacy overall.           
OL,10, OK, so you have a segment on their new

OL,12, reference to a programme Michael Palin 
OL,13, was doing or something, but half the

OL,6, Yes, just what you wanted - vox pops of
OL,7, REAL PEOPLE expressing their hopes and 
OL,8, dreams and visions for 1993 for reasons
OL,9, that I'm sure make perfect sense to    
OL,10, absolutely nobody. Well, it worked for

OL,13, Not to put those ordinary blameless    
OL,14, citizens on the spot (except the young 
OL,15, girl who mentioned Yugoslavia because I
OL,16, can't stand her), but some of these    
OL,17, hopes are downright laughable 25 years 
OL,18, down the line. 'Personally, urrrr, I

OL,7, As I said, it has no place or reason to
OL,8, be there as it has nothing to do with  
OL,9, how you intend to use your new role as 
OL,10, a television broadcaster. Nor does

OL,12, baby that has been born during the live
OL,13, programme.                             
OL,15, The section on how much booze you can  
OL,16, now carry through Dover customs also   
OL,17, seems odd and distant, and was anyone  
OL,18, else suddenly reminded of 'The Day     
OL,19, Today' when Alison Holloway dropped

OL,6, And to cap it all off, Sean Connery    
OL,7, wishes Meridian good luck in the final

OL,9, about as Southern English as Mexican   
OL,10, fajitas. He's Scottish, for Christ's   
OL,11, sake. And he lives in the Bahamas.     
OL,13, I'm not saying local television should

OL,15, but as with so many aspects of this    
OL,16, atrocity, particularly the vox pops,
