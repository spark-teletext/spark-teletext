OL,6, Once upon a time, I used to count the  
OL,7, months until a Hollywood blockbuster   
OL,8, ended up on terrestrial television. Sky
OL,9, came along and lengthened that duration
OL,10, by inserting itself in-between         
OL,11, terrestrial broadcasting and home video
OL,12, releases.                              
OL,14, The timeline was simple: a film was    
OL,15, exhibited in a cinema from 0 to 6      
OL,16, months, followed by VHS rental release 
OL,17, for up to a year. You could buy the    
OL,18, film from the 12th month.              
OL,20, By the 18th month we could be treated  
OL,21, to a British television premiere.

OL,6, When Sky Movies began, they secured    
OL,7, a right for a further year until it    
OL,8, finally appeared on BBC or ITV.        
OL,10, This wasn't a bad deal at all speaking 
OL,11, as a teenage viewer. I was well aware  
OL,12, of BBC1 and ITV reformatting the films 
OL,13, to remove strong language and risque   
OL,14, scenes that might, well, corrupt us(!) 
OL,16, I knew Sky broadcasted their           
OL,17, acquisitions uncut, only as far as the 
OL,18, BBFC allowed for home viewing. That's  
OL,19, what made cable and satellite TV such a
OL,20, special thing to have in the 90s.

OL,6, At age 15, I became further interested 
OL,7, in obtaining our very own satellite TV,
OL,8, because Cable London wasn't in our     
OL,9, reach, but more so with a satellite you
OL,10, could access hundreds of other TV      
OL,11, services.                              
OL,13, I subscribed to a monthly newsletter   
OL,14, called TESUG (The European Satellite   
OL,15, User Group) for a year, which I        
OL,16, discovered on UK Gold's teletext.      
OL,18, Home Cinema became my thing too. I was 
OL,19, always buying the What Video magazine  
OL,20, to see how amazing my next video       
OL,21, 'could' be.

OL,6, Moving swiftly back to my purpose of   
OL,7, this post - Pan and Scan and Open      
OL,8, Matte.                                 
OL,10, Yes, aspect ratio still bothers me     
OL,11, today. It's annoying having to press   
OL,12, the button on my remote control to     
OL,13, correct a stretched 4:3 to normal size,
OL,14, but it's the way broadcasters receive  
OL,15, masters in the first place.            
OL,17, Did you know that most films made in   
OL,18, the 80s and 90s were shot with a 4:3   
OL,19, aspect ratio, but cropped to 16:9 at   
OL,20, the cinema?

OL,6, Although nearly all those Open Matte   
OL,7, films were intended for optimum viewing
OL,8, at the cinema, they were destined to   
OL,9, everlast on television.                
OL,11, Rather than having to consider panning 
OL,12, and scanning, films were transferred   
OL,13, with extra visual information above and
OL,14, below the 16:9 frame to fill a 4:3     
OL,15, frame.                                 
OL,17, My personal preference is to obtain as 
OL,18, much visual detail as possible,        
OL,19, considering our TV's are double the    
OL,20, size than the CRTs we used to have.

OL,6, If film distributors are clever at     
OL,7, marketing, as they were selling DVDs in
OL,8, the 2000s, they could present 4K       
OL,9, masters with whatever complete frame is
OL,10, available and let it fit into our 16:9 
OL,11, televisions.                           
OL,13, I cannot help but watch an 80s classic 
OL,14, knowing that I originally saw a full   
OL,15, 4:3 presentation and the version I'm   
OL,16, looking at is cropped to 16:9, even    
OL,17, though I'm not really missing any      
OL,18, significant plot - except one's        
OL,19, forehead! Pick any great John Landis   
OL,20, film and you will see what I mean!

OL,6, My other disagreement is what a few    
OL,7, broadcasters are doing to 80s sitcoms. 
OL,9, I'm grateful to Forces TV for bringing 
OL,10, back a few forgotten gems from Thames' 
OL,11, and BBC's archives, but they're        
OL,12, presented in 16:9 and could need some  
OL,13, form of pan and scan, compromising     
OL,14, detail. but I am sure the average      
OL,15, viewer would hate to have black bars on
OL,16, the side of their telly, thinking their
OL,17, set 'might' be broken.                 
OL,19, Mustn't grumble though - I just need to
OL,20, get out more! :-D
