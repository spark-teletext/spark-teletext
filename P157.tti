OL,6, The DoctorGleft Time Lord society to   
OL,7, experience The Universe, instead of    
OL,8, simply observing it. She's brave,      
OL,9, clever, silly and sometimes fallible,  
OL,10, even when she was male. When in a      
OL,11, tight spot, rarely will she bring      
OL,12, superior force to bear; her solutions  
OL,13, are instead rather ingenious.          
OL,15, After about 30 years on TV, the show   
OL,16, was 'rested' in the 1990s. It became   
OL,17, an even greater success on its return  
OL,18, in 2005. Entire families often gather  
OL,19, to immerse themselves in the universe  
OL,20, of the series. In the 21st century,    
OL,21, The Doctor's love of diverse cultures  
OL,22, is satisfied spectacularly - and she   
OL,23, invites us along on that adventure.

OL,6, The Doctor has shared her ship   VH0   
OL,7, with many friendly Earthlings  T j/?o

OL,9, These include a journalist fromT j 

OL,15, programme's stars invited the world    
OL,16, aboard the TARDIS and were met with    
OL,17, huge enthusiasm. For a tale so very    
OL,18, cosmic, Doctor Who really connects     
OL,19, with audiences on a personal level.    
OL,21, It's been a pure delight how Doctor    
OL,22, Who has changed so much - but still    
OL,23, retains its appeal.   F- Pete Fagan   \
