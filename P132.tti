OL,14, Josie was still talking about the      
OL,15, Queen's funeral, and seemed to still be
OL,16, having a period of mourning herself.   
OL,18, "Wasn't it a beautiful service in      
OL,19, Windsor, that seemed so much more      
OL,20, personal than Westminster Abbey, son," 
OL,21, Sam wasn't totally engaged in this!

OL,6, "That's because it was, Mum," he rolled
OL,7, his eyes, as he flicked through the TV 
OL,8, channels.                              
OL,10, "Oh, stop on that one, love - it's a   
OL,11, new documentary about King Charles!"   
OL,12, Sam skipped back, thinking he'd almost 
OL,13, diverted her attention.                
OL,15, "Haven't you seen enough of this yet?" 
OL,17, "Don't be so cheeky! And it's better   
OL,18, than the tripe you always want to      
OL,19, watch!" She sipped her tea, feeling all
OL,20, cosy, as long awaited rain lashed down 
OL,21, outside.

OL,6, Sam tuned out, scrolling through social
OL,7, media on his phone again, not paying   
OL,8, any attention to a word now.           
OL,10, Don walked in, took one look at the    
OL,11, telly, then rolled his eyes and winked 
OL,12, at Sam.                                
OL,14, "Fancy a pint, son?"                   
OL,16, "Thought you'd never ask!" They went to
OL,17, leave and Josie snapped back into the  
OL,18, room.                                  
OL,20, "Don't be late for lunch, 2pm! I don't

OL,6, Meanwhile, in the Rose and Crown that  
OL,7, Sunday, Richard Harvey was having a    
OL,8, pint with Max.                         
OL,10, "We haven't done this for ages, mate,  
OL,11, I've missed you!" Max patted his arm,  
OL,12, and they clinked glasses.              
OL,14, "The joys of fatherhood! Usually means 
OL,15, I can't do things like this any more!  
OL,16, Rach has taken Harry over to a friends,
OL,17, so few hours to myself today!"         
OL,19, Max grinned mischievously.

OL,9, Porter?!"                              
OL,11, They both suddenly felt deadly serious 
OL,12, for a moment.                          
OL,14, "Sorry, that was probably insensitive, 
OL,15, he was your mate, wasn't he.."         
OL,17, "Is my mate, he's not necessarily dead,

OL,6, Max chilled out again -                
OL,8, "Don't worry, I know what you mean. He 
OL,9, may be dead, or not, and we may never  
OL,10, know for sure. He's pulled some stunts 
OL,11, before, including some disappearing    
OL,12, acts, but nothing like this."          
OL,14, "I can't believe the police have drawn 
OL,15, a blank so far..." Rich looked worried 
OL,16, himself.                               
OL,18, "I can, Rich. James was involved in    
OL,19, more than anyone ever knew, I reckon,  
OL,20, and knew some very shady characters.   
OL,21, The kind who can outsmart the police!"
