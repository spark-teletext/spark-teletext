OL,6, Ali shifted uncomfortably in her seat, 
OL,7, fiddling with her hair.                
OL,9, "Not sure, he's been in the clinic a   
OL,10, long time, much longer than last time -
OL,11, I hope it's the last time too! I'm     
OL,12, nervous that he won't be the old       
OL,13, Paul...."                              
OL,15, "Understandable nerves, my love, but   
OL,16, you'll all be fine I'm sure. He needs  
OL,17, to be home now.....and the kids?" Josie
OL,18, knew Laura and the family were still   
OL,19, estranged, but she wasn't one to shy   
OL,20, away from the truth.

OL,6, "Rhys is scared to death. He's always  
OL,7, been sensitive, but this experience is 
OL,8, killing him, now that he's at college  
OL,9, and more in touch with adult           
OL,10, stuff...and Laura...."                 
OL,12, "Does Nathan allow her to comment?!"   
OL,14, Ali hissed "He....yes, she has called  
OL,15, me and even popped around the house one
OL,16, day, so I feel like I may get her back 
OL,17, one day. It's baby steps. She's upset  
OL,18, about Paul, always was a Daddy's girl!"
OL,20, Josie remembered the days when Laura   
OL,21, used to skip along Rex Road.

OL,6, She went hand in hand with Paul, the   
OL,7, apple of his eye. Such a beautiful girl
OL,8, too, and young woman now.              
OL,10, "What time is he due?"                 
OL,12, "4pm they said, I need to head back    
OL,13, really and get things ready..."        
OL,15, Rach and Dan had been avoiding each    
OL,16, other lately, and she didn't really    
OL,17, have time for him in the run up to     
OL,18, Christmas. Business at the salon was   
OL,19, hectic, and she was taking over the    
OL,20, business as her own now. Did she have  
OL,21, time to conduct an affair?

OL,6, A bit of fun, as well as look after    
OL,7, Richard and Harry?                     
OL,9, Just as he popped into her head, he    
OL,10, appeared in the street too, heading    
OL,11, straight for her.                      
OL,13, "Hey there, shall we meet soon?"       
OL,15, When the butterflies launched in her   
OL,16, tummy, that was the giveaway, she knew 
OL,17, that she would be seeing him again soon
OL,18, for sure!

OL,6, Paul got out of the car outside, as Ali
OL,7, bit her nails inside the house.        
OL,9, She put an arm around Rhys, and they   
OL,10, gripped each other tightly, as though  
OL,11, they were about to welcome a stranger  
OL,12, into the home.                         
OL,14, Laura was nowhere to be seem, despite  
OL,15, the invitation.                        
OL,17, He stepped into the lounge, with his   
OL,18, caseworker, and Ali flung her arms     
OL,19, around him. He hesitated, but then     
OL,20, began to cry. They seen each other, but
OL,21, this was different. He was home.
