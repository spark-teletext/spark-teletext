OL,19, "Oh, baby, I am so sorry! Please,

OL,6, He was distraught, and Laura felt sick 
OL,7, to her stomach, wondering what on Earth
OL,8, was going on. Her relationship had been
OL,9, bliss, but something had changed in    
OL,10, him. She was scared of him now, and    
OL,11, didn't know what to do or say.         
OL,13, "Just leave me alone, I don't          
OL,14, understand what I did that was so      
OL,15, wrong, I didn't deserve that!" She     
OL,16, sobbed, but stopped short of holding   
OL,17, his hand.                              
OL,19, "I'm so sorry, I don't know what       
OL,20, happened to me, I just got so angry. I 
OL,21, shouldn't have, I am so sorry!

OL,6, Please, please don't tell anyone!"     
OL,8, Laura's face contorted in anger -      
OL,10, "Ah, so all you are worried about is my
OL,11, not telling Mum, Dad and Rhys?!"       
OL,13, "No, no, it's not just that. I love    
OL,14, you, I want you to forgive me, please. 
OL,15, But they would kill me, and rightly so,
OL,16, and then we would have no chance of a

OL,6, About how no man should ever lay a     
OL,7, finger on her like this. She should be 
OL,8, walking away, she should be telling    
OL,9, everybody about him. Yet...            
OL,11, "I do love you. You know I do. This    
OL,12, time....okay, but this can't happen    
OL,13, again," she glared at him, through tear
OL,14, filled eyes.                           
OL,16, "Thank you, babe, thank you. I will    
OL,17, make it up to you, am so sorry," he    
OL,18, kissed her hand gently.                
OL,20, Now she had to think of a good excuse

OL,6, Dan Morgan was making an impression on 
OL,7, Rex Road, and he was now in the back   
OL,8, garden at Number Six, enjoying the     
OL,9, sunshine and a cup of coffee that      
OL,10, Sunday morning.                        
OL,12, "Good morning!" Rachel Watson was      
OL,13, putting washing on the line next door, 
OL,14, and leant on the fence, big smile on   
OL,15, her face.                              
OL,17, "Hello, how are you? I'm Dan," he
