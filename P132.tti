OL,6,CLast time, on Rex Road:FJack, Jo and   
OL,7,FLil were taken to hospital after the   
OL,8,Ffire at the pub. Nathan used the

OL,14, Don and Josie sipped their morning tea,

OL,17, "They were lucky it wasn't so much     
OL,18, worse, they could have been killed!"   
OL,19, Josie felt upset by what had happened,

OL,21, having known Lil for decades.

OL,6, "Do you know if there was much damage?"
OL,8, "Not terrible, apparently! Which was   
OL,9, lucky too, such a beautiful old        
OL,10, building, we could have lost that      
OL,11, forever! It's an Alborford landmark,   
OL,12, but it seems the damage was kept in one
OL,13, part of the bar and back room, and can 
OL,14, be repaired and restored!"             
OL,16, "We've been going in that pub for so   
OL,17, many years, and Jack is probably the

OL,6, "How are you doing, Jack?" A nurse     
OL,7, asked, taking his blood pressure.
