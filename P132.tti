OL,6, Don sat back down again with yet       
OL,7, another whisky, and handed Josie one.  
OL,9, "Do you remember the night that we     
OL,10, first kissed?" Don asked out of the    
OL,11, blue. Josie was taken aback, but began 
OL,12, to smile.                              
OL,14, "Yes I do, how could I forget?"        
OL,16, "You were the most beautiful checkout  
OL,17, girl in that supermarket, every man in 
OL,18, Nottingham was in awe of you," Don     
OL,19, smiled.

OL,6, "Your family didn't think that I was

OL,8, thought you were too good for me!"     
OL,10, "They thought I was a snob!" Josie

OL,6, More than David and Sylvia ever were." 
OL,8, 'The crash' was the 1975 car crash that
OL,9, killed Josie's parents. And David and  
OL,10, Sylvia Parker were her brother and     
OL,11, sister.                                
OL,13, "That's true...Sylvia in particular is 
OL,14, a nightmare to this day, always the    
OL,15, troublemaker...wonder what she's up to?
OL,16, She certainly tried to come between us 
OL,17, when I had trouble conceiving Sam!" Her
OL,18, words tailed off as they both realised 
OL,19, what she was saying.

OL,6, In fact, after the stress of Fred and  
OL,7, June Parker's deaths, they were lucky  
OL,8, to have had any children at all, but   
OL,9, Sam was a baby they desperately wanted,
OL,10, and had assumed that he was the result 
OL,11, of a long wait.                        
OL,13, "Anyway, about Jimmy, I think we should
OL,14, strike while the iron's hot," said Don.
OL,16, "Do you mean that we should track him  
OL,17, down?" Josie felt terrified!           
OL,19, "Well of course that's what I mean, we 
OL,20, need to get this over and done with, if
OL,21, we stand any chance!"
