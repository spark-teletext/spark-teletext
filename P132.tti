OL,14, Ros and Sam had managed to slip away,

OL,16, Hamborough town. They'd both taken some

OL,6, Sam held the door for Ros, as they     
OL,7, entered a cafe and took a seat for

OL,14, "I'm fine! More worried about you! How

OL,6, "The impression that what?" She'd gone 
OL,7, quiet, wondering if anyone was         
OL,8, listening too closely.                 
OL,10, "...that they have nothing at all to go
