OL,15, "Max has questioned me a couple of     
OL,16, times, he knows something is up!" Sam  
OL,17, found a chance to chat to Ros, as they 
OL,18, wandered through Alborford Park - which
OL,19, during the current heatwave was totally
OL,20, parched, and also quite quiet.

OL,6, "You really need to be careful, I'm not
OL,7, having you muck this up for both of us,
OL,8, you know!" She squeezed his hand a bit 
OL,9, too hard, and he realised that he      
OL,10, sometimes felt a bit scared by Ros.    
OL,12, After all, he knew what she was capable
OL,13, of now, and this whole business had    
OL,14, driven him to distraction.             
OL,16, "I know, I know, I haven't told him    
OL,17, anything. Made up something about work,
OL,18, nothing to do with you!" She smiled    
OL,19, with an inward vulnerable relief.      
OL,21, "It's all going a bit cold now.

OL,6, It will be worth it, we can be together
OL,7, before too long..."                    
OL,9, Sam laughed.                           
OL,11, "Not that soon though, it will look    
OL,12, very dodgy if we become an item too    
OL,13, early - we need to play the card of me 
OL,14, being supportive, and building up to   
OL,15, being more than a shoulder to cry on?" 
OL,17, Ros patted him on the back.            
OL,19, "There you go, you can do this!"       
OL,21, Rich and Rachel were out and about.

OL,6, Little Harry was sheltered in a        
OL,7, pushchair, after being slathered in sun
OL,8, cream by a nervous Rachel - all the    
OL,9, news about rising temperatures were    
OL,10, meaning she worried about looking after
OL,11, him all the more. Something she'd been 
OL,12, very paranoid about, but was keeping   
OL,13, secret.                                
OL,15, They stopped off at a cafe, getting    
OL,16, under parasols and watching the ducks  
OL,17, in the pond, Harry squealing with      
OL,18, delight!                               
OL,20, "I think he may want a little friend   
OL,21, soon, you know," Richard smiled.

OL,6, "He's loving playgroup, you already    
OL,7, know he's making lots of little pals   
OL,8, there? Oh...I see..."                  
OL,10, "Yes, I think we should give him a     
OL,11, little brother or sister? Don't you?"  
OL,13, "Er, yes, of course...that would be    
OL,14, lovely," but the idea instantly        
OL,15, petrified her. How was she going to    
OL,16, tell her husband that?!                
OL,18, Phil and Kris were watching telly, with
OL,19, the blinds closed, fan on full blast,  
OL,20, drinking ice cool beers.

OL,6, "I love a warm weekend, but this is

OL,8, wiping sweat from his brow.
