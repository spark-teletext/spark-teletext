OL,19, keep a lid on his nerves and his doubts
OL,20, about her, a prisoner in the situation.

OL,6, Rachel had begun an affair with Dan    
OL,7, from the student house, in spite of    
OL,8, Rich being suspicious before it had    
OL,9, even begun - she gave in to            
OL,10, temptations, and continued to play with
OL,11, fire!                                  
OL,13, Meanwhile, at the Lucases, Laura and   
OL,14, Nathan had moved out - in spite of his 
OL,15, intermittent abuse, Laura just loved   
OL,16, him too much to break away. Ali        
OL,17, attempted to interfere one time too    
OL,18, many - it had now driven a wedge       
OL,19, between mother and daughter. Something 
OL,20, that made Nathan very happy!

OL,6, Over at the Rose and Crown, Jack and Jo
OL,7, were making plans to get married, with 
OL,8, a July wedding in the diary - neither  
OL,9, of them had ever been so happy, even   
OL,10, with insecurities whispering in their  
OL,11, ears.                                  
OL,13, "Darling, so Alborford Abbey is        
OL,14, confirmed! Can you imagine, it's going 
OL,15, to be so beautiful in there!"          
OL,17, Jack kissed her -                      
OL,19, "Oh, it sure is, darling! And are you  
OL,20, sure about the reception? That you     
OL,21, wouldn't prefer, say, the hotel?"

OL,8, happiest, it just feels so right! And  
OL,9, we can walk from the Abbey to here     
OL,10, too!"                                  
OL,12, He smiled broadly -                    
OL,14, "With all our drunk customers too!"    
OL,16, The Reynolds family were still steady -
OL,17, in spite of Josie feeling ill lately - 
OL,18, and they'd even calmed down about Sam  
OL,19, being with Ros.                        
OL,21, They realised they had no choice!

OL,6, If they hadn't accepted her, they would
OL,7, lose Sam - and Josie wasn't prepared to
OL,8, do that, for anyone!                   
OL,10, Max and Fiona talked about marriage,   
OL,11, yet never seemed to do anything about  
OL,12, it - and they wondered if he was too   
OL,13, much of a loose cannon to settle down. 
OL,14, Was she really the one?                
OL,16, "Let's hope 2024 brings us good luck,  
OL,17, my love!" Don filled their glasses with
OL,18, wine again and raised a toast.         
OL,20, "So much for dry January, love?!"

OL,6, "Ah, bugger that, I need a drink, being

OL,9, Someone who didn't need a drink, but   
OL,10, was - Paul Lucas.                      
OL,12, The strain of losing Laura's contact   
OL,13, was proving too much, and Ali realised 
OL,14, that he was out again, lost hours in a 
OL,15, pub somewhere, on his own.             
OL,17, She thought about looking for him, but 
OL,18, just wanted to curl up and forget about
OL,19, everything!
