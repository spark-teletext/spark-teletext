OL,6, Last time on Rex Road: Don and Josie   
OL,7, announced they were going to the       
OL,8, Maldives on holiday; Richard rushed to 
OL,9, his mother, who was in hospital after a
OL,10, stroke; Jack and Jo enjoyed a lie in,  
OL,11, as a fire broke out downstairs in the  
OL,12, pub!                                   
OL,14, EPISODE 101                            
OL,16, Laura and Nathan strolled hand in hand 
OL,17, through Alborford town centre,         
OL,18, discussing how they would be accepted. 
OL,20, "Dad is never going to be happy to     
OL,21, welcome you into the house!"

OL,6, Laura had been upset ever since        
OL,7, Christmas and New Year, when Nathan was
OL,8, asked to leave.                        
OL,10, "Does it really matter though? You're  
OL,11, allowed to see who you want! Stop      
OL,12, seeing them!" His patience was running 
OL,13, out.                                   
OL,15, "What do you mean?"                    
OL,17, "You can move out, live with me,       
OL,18, that'll show them! Or we can leave     
OL,19, Alborford altogether, they'd really    
OL,20, have something to worry about then!"   
OL,21, Nathan grinned and thought about it.

OL,6, He was thrilled at the thought of      
OL,7, getting the upper hand.                
OL,9, Laura continued to walk, looking       
OL,10, vacantly into shop windows, but deep in
OL,11, thought - maybe he was right, why      
OL,12, should she keep paying so much         
OL,13, attention to what others think? Maybe  
OL,14, it was time to show them action!       
OL,16, "You're right, maybe we should head off
OL,17, altogether!"                           
OL,19, He smiled even more, knowing she would 
OL,20, likely do anything he wanted, he loved 
OL,21, the idea of control.

OL,6, Rachel was on the phone to Richard.    
OL,8, "What have the doctor's said today?"   
OL,10, "She's been lucky to survive, it was   
OL,11, quite a large stroke...but with rehab  
OL,12, and recovery time, they think her      
OL,13, chances are strong...was so scared,    
OL,14, darling, but I feel a bit more positive
OL,15, after that!"                           
OL,17, "Oh Rich, I bet, I've been so worried, 
OL,18, she's a strong lady, if anyone can come
OL,19, back from this, she can!"              
OL,21, They both thought the same thing -

OL,6, she had driven them nuts for years, but
OL,7, her dogged personality would be her    
OL,8, saviour now!                           
OL,10, Don and Josie were packing bags, ready 
OL,11, to head to the airport the next day.   
OL,13, "Don't be sad, son, you're going to    
OL,14, have the house to yourself for two     
OL,15, weeks!" Josie said to a scowling Sam.  
OL,16, His mood lifted at that. Good point, he
OL,17, thought, Ros would be able to pop round
OL,18, during their time away!                
OL,20, Back in the town centre, Nathan and

OL,6, Getting closer to the Rose and Crown,  
OL,7, Laura gasped -                         
OL,9, "Is that smoke?!"                      
OL,11, Nathan looked and spotted smoke        
OL,12, appearing from underneath the main

OL,18, He ran over to the door and hammered

OL,20, passers by.
