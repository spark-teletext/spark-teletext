OL,6,CLast time, on Rex Road:Fwith one week  
OL,7,Fto go before Ros's plan was due, Sam   
OL,8,Fwas becoming desperate; Paul's resolve 
OL,9,Fwas weakening in the face of Nathan    
OL,10,Fpressurising him, and he almost began

OL,15, Sam had barely slept that night,       
OL,16, awakening to the sounds of birds       
OL,17, tweeting through the window, and Don   
OL,18, and Josie stirring downstairs and      
OL,19, watching more coverage of the Platinum 
OL,20, Jubilee on TV.

OL,6, Sam rolled over in bed and groaned..   
OL,8, "Never mind the Queen, God save me!"   
OL,10, Josie appeared in his bedroom moments  
OL,11, later.                                 
OL,13, "I thought I heard you moving around,  
OL,14, here's a cuppa for you, love!"         
OL,16, "Thanks, Mum," she could always make   
OL,17, him smile.                             
OL,19, "You doing much today? All this lovely 
OL,20, time off, courtesy of Her Majesty!"    
OL,21, Josie was a Royalist for sure!

OL,6, She'd organised a street party for Rex 
OL,7, Road, as well as having other plans in 
OL,8, town, across the weekend.              
OL,10, "Jack and Jo are having a garden party,
OL,11, with a couple of bands, so will        
OL,12, probably head there later...and.."     
OL,14, "...and be back for the street party of
OL,15, course!"                               
OL,17, "Of course, Mum!" He grinned. She left 
OL,18, smiling, and his face dropped          
OL,19, instantly. Today would be the day,     
OL,20, James was due to be killed. His own    
OL,21, life could be over soon too.

OL,6, Later, Josie was directing Don and Paul
OL,7, in arranging the tables and chairs,    
OL,8, bunting and decorations, along Rex     
OL,9, Road.                                  
OL,11, She admired the handiwork coming       
OL,12, together, remembering the Diamond and  
OL,13, Golden Jubilees, and right back to the 
OL,14, Silver in 1977 - how different life was
OL,15, then, and how fast the years have flown
OL,16, by.                                    
OL,18, She thought about the Queen, and her   
OL,19, legacy. What a figure, present         
OL,20, throughout their lives, a constant! And
OL,21, what of her legacy? She was so proud.

OL,6, Max and Sam were growing up at last -  
OL,7, she knew Sam was still seeing Ros, but 
OL,8, it looked as though it may work out    
OL,9, after all for him.                     
OL,11, "Hello Mum! We thought we'd turn up    
OL,12, early with supplies!" Max and Fiona    
OL,13, sprang from nowhere, with bags and     
OL,14, boxes of booze and food at the ready.  
OL,16, Time ticked by, and residents gathered 
OL,17, - music played, drinks flowed, laughter
OL,18, rang out along Rex Road as the sun     
OL,19, shined on them all!                    
OL,21, Ros and James were there too.

OL,6, Sam joined the family a few tables     
OL,7, down, and he had a perfect line of     
OL,8, sight, to read Ros's facial            
OL,9, expressions. They had argued, her      
OL,10, insistence on going ahead threatening  
OL,11, everything.                            
OL,13, James was his typical self - playing to
OL,14, the crowd, showing off to anyone female
OL,15, in particular, and getting             
OL,16, progressively drunker too.             
OL,18, "You having fun, my darling?" He       
OL,19, slurred to Ros, grabbing her arm a     
OL,20, little too tight.

OL,6, "How many have you had?!" She asked.   
OL,8, His expression changed.                
OL,10, "Oh for goodness sake, I gave up Clare 
OL,11, for you, and you're being a right nag  
OL,12, and misery guts! Live a little!"       
OL,14, "You're right! Be a sweetie please,    
OL,15, will you pop to the shop and get my

OL,6, He staggered across the street,        
OL,7, checking his pockets for money,        
OL,8, laughing and chatting to all sorts of  
OL,9, people, as he continued down Rex Road. 
OL,11, Ros fixed her gaze on him, watched     
OL,12, every step intently, as he passed the  
OL,13, numbers - six, four, two - almost at   
OL,14, the end now, the wheels of the vehicle 
OL,15, just visible around the corner. James  
OL,16, disappeared around the corner, and she 
OL,17, smiled, lifting a glass to her lips,   
OL,18, taking a gulp of booze.
