OL,6, Kris instantly changed her mind too,   
OL,7, and Phil shot her a look, as Dan left

OL,16, She just laughed, and went to find her

OL,6, As they continued, Rach was further    
OL,7, down the road behind them, and noticed 
OL,8, Dan ahead. She instantly perked up, and
OL,9, decided to follow them.                
OL,11, Calling Rich on her mobile, she made   
OL,12, her excuses to be home late and

OL,6, Ali was questioning her daughter across
OL,7, the kitchen table.                     
OL,9, She'd noticed things heating up between
OL,10, them, and a new side to Nathan in      
OL,11, recent weeks. It seemed that his true  
OL,12, colours were starting to crack through 
OL,13, the facade now.                        
OL,15, Would Laura admit to what was going on 
OL,16, though?                                
OL,18, "How dare you?!"
