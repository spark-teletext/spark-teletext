OL,9, They all collapsed on the sofa, Harry  
OL,10, laughing.                              
OL,12, "Ah, what a great trip that was, am so

OL,9, "You're right, we're still on holiday

OL,12, Meanwhile, further down Rex Road, Phil 
OL,13, was chatting to Kris and Jo and had    
OL,14, some news.                             
OL,16, "Well, you know I was away a couple of

OL,6, You're still transferring are you?"    
OL,8, Phil chuckled at her usual cynicism -  
OL,10, "Well, no I am not any more! There's a 
OL,11, restructure going on and I have secured
OL,12, a promotion in Norwich instead! So it

OL,16, Kris and Jo both whooped for joy and   
OL,17, jumped up from their seats, going to

OL,12, "Amazing, Phil! So we only have to look

OL,14, laughed, poking him in the ribs.       
OL,16, "Yeah, that's true, we still haven't

OL,6, Should we go down that route, or       
OL,7, advertise and interview candidates?    
OL,8, That might be fun!" Jo replied,        
OL,9, imagining some of her friends having to
OL,10, share a house with the volatile Kris!  
OL,12, "I like that idea, we can grill them!  
OL,13, Let's advertise!" Kris grinned, the    
OL,14, mischief in her eyes shining.          
OL,16, "Nice one, ladies, let's get that      
OL,17, sorted this week then. Am so glad I am
