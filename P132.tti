OL,13, When another baby comes, it's

OL,6, Kris was sat at the bar in the Rose and
OL,7, Crown, drinking and chatting to Jo.    
OL,9, "So, do you think you and Jack are     
OL,10, likely to get hitched? Has he popped   
OL,11, the question at all?"                  
OL,13, Jo pulled a face - "Blimey, where did  
OL,14, that question come from?!"             
OL,16, "Just wondered, it seems like true love
OL,17, to me, and a natural thing!"

OL,6, Kris swigged the last of her gin and   
OL,7, tonic, and gestured for another.       
OL,9, "Thanks babe. No it doesn't, but maybe 
OL,10, I'm an old fashioned girl at heart!"   
OL,11, Kris smiled.                           
OL,13, "Of course you are! Anyway, no he      
OL,14, hasn't popped any question lately,     
OL,15, other than when is the brewery delivery

OL,6, Maybe he doesn't want to marry again,  
OL,7, after the death of his first wife? I   
OL,8, guess that could be the way he feels?" 
OL,10, Kris's words then made Jo unsettled,   
OL,11, and her thoughts went to all manner of

OL,14, "Yes, it could be that, we've not
