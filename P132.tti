OL,6,CLast time, on Rex Road:FRemembrance    
OL,7,FSunday saw residents gather at the War 
OL,8,FMemorial in Alborford. And Laura saw a 
OL,9,Fside to Nathan she really didn't like.

OL,13, Nathan and Laura hadn't been getting on
OL,14, too well lately, and she decided to    
OL,15, head out for a walk around town that   
OL,16, Saturday afternoon.                    
OL,18, "Oh hello, love," it was Fiona Redfern,
OL,19, looking bubbly and full of beans. Laura
OL,20, always thought she looks ridiculous, in
OL,21, garish fashion.

OL,6, She was harmless enough though, and    
OL,7, meant well - like an overexcited puppy.
OL,9, "You okay, you look a bit peaky?" She  
OL,10, asked, pulling an over the top         
OL,11, concerned face.                        
OL,13, "Oh, hiya, I'm fine thanks. I did feel 
OL,14, a bit below par, so decided to get out 
OL,15, and about for some fresh air! How are  
OL,16, you?" Please don't tell me, thought    
OL,17, Laura.                                 
OL,19, Fiona was quickly oblivious to Laura's 
OL,20, interests or plight, talking about     
OL,21, herself quickly.

OL,6, "Oh, good thanks, hun! Max is taking me
OL,7, out today, probably off to Holkham -   
OL,8, walk on the beach, then go for dinner  
OL,9, at The Victoria! Have you been there?" 
OL,11, Laura almost rolled her eyes.          
OL,13, "No...I mean, yes I have been to       
OL,14, Holkham, but not the Victoria. More of 
OL,15, a chips on Wells quay kinda girl, me!" 
OL,17, Fiona pulled a bit of a face and       
OL,18, shrugged her shoulders.                
OL,20, "Each to their own, eh sweetie! Catch  
OL,21, ya later!" She practically skipped.

OL,6, Laura continued, passing by The        
OL,7, Magnolia Beauty Salon, where she       
OL,8, spotted Rachel Harvey chatting to      
OL,9, customers intently.                    
OL,11, It fascinated her, and Rach was someone
OL,12, she secretly looked up to and admired, 
OL,13, although they had rarely spoken.       
OL,15, She seemed classy, and had it all - the
OL,16, family, the man, the job that she loved
OL,17, - and beauty and brains rolled into    
OL,18, one.                                   
OL,20, She almost stared for a bit too long,  
OL,21, and decided to move away.

OL,6, Along the High Street, some familiar   
OL,7, faces mingled with plenty she didn't   
OL,8, recognised. A couple of new businesses 
OL,9, had opened - a boutique and a new      
OL,10, gaming store, both of which were       
OL,11, attracting their new customers thick   
OL,12, and fast.                              
OL,14, Looking at her watch, she realised that
OL,15, she was meant to meet Nathan in a few  
OL,16, minutes time back at the house - and   
OL,17, she was in danger of being late.       
OL,19, He had become more critical lately, and
OL,20, this would give him the perfect chance 
OL,21, to criticise her more!

OL,6, If she were to let him down time wise, 
OL,7, how would she get anything else right?!
OL,9, Rex Road was five extra minutes away,  
OL,10, and she walked faster and faster,      
OL,11, practically breaking into a sprint for 
OL,12, the final steps. Bursting through the  
OL,13, door, he was there waiting of course.  
OL,15, "Late. I can't even rely on you to get 
OL,16, that right! Useless, what are you?!" He
OL,17, raged.                                 
OL,19, Laura's lip began to tremble, as she   
OL,20, saw him flex his hand - "Useless."
