OL,6, "Well, it's a fact, you're so loved up 
OL,7, with Jacky boy, and that doesn't pay   
OL,8, our rent, frankly! Haven't you heard   
OL,9, about energy bills! Cost of living

OL,12, Jo rolled her eyes.                    
OL,14, "Funnily enough, I had heard one or two

OL,6, Jack was busy around the place,        
OL,7, preparing Sunday lunches with Lil, and 
OL,8, the place seemed heaving.              
OL,10, "Not that you're going to have any

OL,6, Kris teased, only half joking though.  
OL,8, "I will, of course!" She looked at     
OL,9, Jack, who blew a kiss from across the  
OL,10, room.                                  
OL,12, Kris kept looking around, always nosing
OL,13, to see who may walk through the door.  
OL,15, "Oh look what the cat dragged in, stuck
OL,16, up Harvey and her boys," Kris scowled  
OL,17, when Rachel and Richard walked in, with
OL,18, Harry giggling and toddling along.

OL,6, There was never any love lost between  
OL,7, her and Rachel in particular.          
OL,9, "Hello Kris, playing the bar fly?" Rach
OL,10, grinned, passing Harry a toy.          
OL,12, "What's it to you?"                    
OL,14, "Nothing at all, just here for a nice  
OL,15, Sunday lunch, so I'll bid you good day 
OL,16, and move on," Rachel's manner only     
OL,17, wound her up even more.

OL,9, "What did she have to say?" Richard
