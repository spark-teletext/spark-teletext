OL,16, Porters dinner and the wine was        
OL,17, flowing. Something they all had in

OL,6, Ros smiled at her and thought how much 
OL,7, she hated the bitch really. She had    
OL,8, always hated her. From the first time  
OL,9, they had met, she knew that Cathy and  
OL,10, James were weirdly close - wouldn't    
OL,11, surprise her if incest was happening!  
OL,13, Cathy, after all, was a slag - she'd   
OL,14, long since dumped Mr MacDonald (whoever
OL,15, he was, Ros only met him a couple of   
OL,16, times) and slept with most of East     
OL,17, Anglia...including Rhys Lucas down the 
OL,18, road! And now, she was going to have to
OL,19, pull the wool over her eyes. She may be
OL,20, trouble, but she was smart...this      
OL,21, wouldn't be easy!

OL,6, "I've got to chat to the pigs tomorrow,
OL,7, about the last time I saw              
OL,8, James...should be fun! This whole thing
OL,9, is smelling very fishy. You two were   
OL,10, getting on better, weren't you?" Cathy 
OL,11, asked, eyeballing her.                 
OL,13, "Oh yeah, course. I mean, he was seeing
OL,14, someone from work...but that was the

OL,17, Cathy knew about it of course, and

OL,6, It's good that you didn't fight against
OL,7, it, and accepted that was the way it   
OL,8, was. If you want a man as great as my  
OL,9, brother, you have to accept that so    
OL,10, many women love him!"
