OL,14, A New Year was meaning new beginnings  
OL,15, for many in Alborford and Rex Road.    
OL,17, For Kris and Phil, it meant they       
OL,18, welcomed a new housemate at long last. 
OL,19, Dan Morgan, the mature student who had 
OL,20, visited a while ago, was still         
OL,21, searching for the right place.

OL,6, After a few more chats, and Kris       
OL,7, calming down her flirting on Phil's    
OL,8, advice, he agreed to sign up for a six 
OL,9, month lodging.                         
OL,11, He arrived, laden down with a few bags,
OL,12, and a couple of shifting looking mates 
OL,13, helping him, before they quickly made  
OL,14, themselves scarce.                     
OL,16, "Don't your mates want to have a beer  
OL,17, or anything?" Kris asked, unable to    
OL,18, resist the temptation to touch his     
OL,19, exposed bulging bicep,                 
OL,21, "Er, no, they're a bit shy." He smiled.

OL,6, Noticing her bemused expression, he    
OL,7, laughed.                               
OL,9, "They're a bit geeky if I'm honest, you
OL,10, probably scare them!"                  
OL,12, "She'd scare any man, I'm out of my    
OL,13, wits most of the time!" Phil laughed,  
OL,14, appearing from nowhere and shaking his 
OL,15, hand.                                  
OL,17, "Alright mister, watch it!" Kris

OL,9, should be nice to make it your own now,

OL,11, quite formal.                          
OL,13, "We're quite free and easy here, but as
OL,14, we said there are some rules, we

OL,6, "No girlfriend that you're keen to have
OL,7, staying here then?" Kris asked, Phil   
OL,8, shooting her a look. She was determined
OL,9, to find out more about his love life,  
OL,10, one way or another.                    
OL,12, "Nobody special right now, so you have

OL,6, He stood in the kitchen, staring down  
OL,7, the hallway to meet her gaze as she    
OL,8, walked towards him.                    
OL,10, "You okay, darling?" She asked

OL,8, "Nothing's wrong, I just forgot, I     
OL,9, don't recall you saying it was an
