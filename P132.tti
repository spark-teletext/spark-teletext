OL,6, Last week on Rex Road: Cathy and Rhys  
OL,7, kept seeing each other, and she set    
OL,8, some ground rules; Josie wasn't sure   
OL,9, Max was made for marriage; Jo turned up
OL,10, - engaged!                             
OL,12, EPISODE EIGHTY SIX                     
OL,14, Fiona and Jo were about to start a     
OL,15, shift working in The Rose & Crown, and 
OL,16, were both gushing about their fiances. 
OL,18, "Oh, I know, Max and I can't wait to   
OL,19, start making plans! How about you and, 
OL,20, erm?"

OL,6, "Mike? Oh, we're not going to get      
OL,7, married just yet, I need to finish     
OL,8, College first and, well, he's very     
OL,9, busy!" Jo seemed a bit uneasy about the
OL,10, marriage talk and Fiona realised this  
OL,11, straight away.                         
OL,13, "Everything alright there then, Jo? Is 
OL,14, he as keen on this idea as you are?"   
OL,16, Jo almost smashed a glass she was      
OL,17, cleaning.                              
OL,19, "Of course he is, he wouldn't have     
OL,20, proposed otherwise would he?"

OL,6, "OK, sorry," Fiona realised that she'd 
OL,7, struck a nerve, "I just wondered if    
OL,8, maybe you'd proposed to HIM?"          
OL,10, Jo ignored that and carried on         
OL,11, cleaning.                              
OL,13, "So, when do you think your big day    
OL,14, with Max will be?"                     
OL,16, "Well, I like the idea of a Spring     
OL,17, wedding, so hopefully March or         
OL,18, April...that'd be lovely!" Fiona       
OL,19, simpered off to the restaurant, as Jo  
OL,20, pulled faces at her.

OL,6, Laura and Nathan were in bed together  
OL,7, at the Holland Road flat.              
OL,9, "I don't really like being in the bed  
OL,10, that you've shared with her!" Laura    
OL,11, spat, referring to Lisa.               
OL,13, "I told you, there was something       
OL,14, between us, but I just helped her out  
OL,15, of a tight spot with somewhere to live 
OL,16, really! It's not been that serious!"   
OL,18, Laura had her doubts about whether or  
OL,19, not he was telling her the truth, but  
OL,20, her young naivety took over.

OL,6, She mainly thought that Nathan had     
OL,7, turned over a new leaf.                
OL,9, "Anyway, we'd better go and get        
OL,10, something to eat," Nathan exclaimed,   
OL,11, leaping out of bed and pulling some    
OL,12, jeans on.                              
OL,14, "I guess." Laura sighed, wondering     
OL,15, where this was going.                  
OL,17, "How're things going with the wedding  
OL,18, plans?" Don was asking Max.            
OL,20, "Oh, it's early days yet, lots to do," 
OL,21, Max added.

OL,9, "Yeah, assuming we can get her grand   
OL,10, plans in place in time!"

OL,13, quickie? Nothing wrong with that!"

OL,6, "Hello," said Lisa, looking Laura up   
OL,7, and down warily.                       
OL,9, "Hi Lisa," Laura felt nervous, and knew
OL,10, something wasn't quite right.          
OL,12, "How can we help Laura today?"         
OL,14, Lisa asked, with a definite hostility  
OL,15, in her tone.                           
OL,17, She was eyeballing her and Nathan,     
OL,18, instantly suspicious of their motives. 
OL,20, Nathan was fidgeting, struggling to    
OL,21, hide his nerves.

OL,10, Nathan walked away as he was talking,  
OL,11, and Laura trailed after him.           
OL,13, "Nathan, what's wrong?" Laura tried to 
OL,14, grab his arm, but he moved too quickly 
OL,15, for her. She had a sinking feeling
