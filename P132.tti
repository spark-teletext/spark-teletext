OL,12, Number Ten was still an intense home of
OL,13, strain for Sam, every visit making him 
OL,14, worry more about what the future may   
OL,15, hold. He'd called around early morning,
OL,16, to avoid any nosy neighbours, and spend
OL,17, time with Ros before work.             
OL,19, "What time are they arriving?" Sam     
OL,20, asked. James parents and siblings were 
OL,21, due to visit.

OL,6, Cathy had phoned the night before,     
OL,7, grilling Ros for as long as possible.  
OL,9, "Should be about five, I'm leaving off 
OL,10, work early today, and they're staying  
OL,11, for dinner too."                       
OL,13, "I think I have met them briefly over  
OL,14, the years, but what are they really    
OL,15, like, his parents?"                    
OL,17, Ros smiled "Richard and Helen aren't my
OL,18, kind of people at all! We've tolerated 
OL,19, each other, rather than loved each     
OL,20, other, over the years. They are money

OL,6, He's run a successful property business
OL,7, for years. You wouldn't think they come
OL,8, from Alborford and that they brought up
OL,9, the family here, they're a pair of     
OL,10, jetsetters!" She rolled her eyes,      
OL,11, taking a sip of coffee and rubbing his 
OL,12, leg.

OL,17, holidays they take now they are getting

OL,19, truly tied to the apron strings! He's

OL,6, Takes out his unhappiness on others!   
OL,7, And Cathy....well, we all know her,    
OL,8, don't we? She's trouble and she's lucky
OL,9, she's got away with everything she's   
OL,10, done."                                 
OL,12, Sam swigged more coffee himself.       
OL,14, "Obviously I can't be here to support  
OL,15, you, but I hope it's not too hard going
OL,16, for you, stay strong about it!"        
OL,18, Ros kissed him and they cuddled for a

OL,10, At The Rose & Crown, Jack and Jo were

OL,13, "Ah, it's so nice to finally have the

OL,17, "It so is, babe, they have done such an

OL,6, "I wonder how Ros is? She must be going
OL,7, through hell right now?" Jack wondered.
OL,9, "I know, James has pulled some stunts  
OL,10, over the years, but to just go missing 
OL,11, like that - in the middle of the street
