OL,6, He managed to drag himself up, and     
OL,7, pawed her, as she moved away.          
OL,9, "I love you, darling, please don't be  
OL,10, angry! I just don't know how to        
OL,11, stop...I think I might need some help  
OL,12, again...I...help me, Ali!" He dissolved
OL,13, into tears, collapsing into her arms,  
OL,14, and she felt a wave of relief.         
OL,16, For weeks now, he wasn't admitting     
OL,17, there was a problem, a familiar tale   
OL,18, from when they had problems in previous
OL,19, years. Admitting he needed help was the
OL,20, breakthrough she was praying for.

OL,6, Rachel had collected Harry from pre-   
OL,7, school and walked down Rex Road, and   
OL,8, her heart skipped a beat - as it always
OL,9, did - when she saw Dan walking towards 
OL,10, her. Trouble was, he was with Kris.    
OL,12, "Aw, look at you, little man!" Harry   
OL,13, beamed as Kris grinned at him, tickling
OL,14, him as she got close enough.           
OL,16, "Hello," Rachel smiled at Dan, trying  
OL,17, to ignore the fact her face was        
OL,18, flushing, and soon cooled down when she
OL,19, was Kris staring at her stony faced.   
OL,21, "Hello...you're early...salon closed?"

OL,6, "No, Kris, time in lieu is owed...if   
OL,7, that's alright with you, of course?!"  
OL,8, Dan laughed, loving it when Rach got   
OL,9, feisty.                                
OL,11, "Yes, alright, Lady Penelope! Just

OL,14, nodded reluctantly, as they walked     
OL,15, away, knowing he was missing a chance  
OL,16, to be with Rach, before Rich got home  
OL,17, from work.
