OL,15, Max decided to invite Rich and Rachel  
OL,16, over to Holland Road, for Sunday lunch.
OL,17, He'd really enjoyed having a few beers 
OL,18, with Rich, rekindling a friendship that
OL,19, both of them had neglected in recent   
OL,20, times, with new priorities taking      
OL,21, charge.

OL,6, "Hello, hello, my darlings, come on    
OL,7, in!" Max smiled, as he heard Fiona's   
OL,8, sing song tones welcoming the couple at
OL,9, the front door of the flat.            
OL,11, "Hiya, here you go, some flowers for   
OL,12, you," Rach added.                      
OL,14, "And lots of wine for everyone!" Rich  
OL,15, laughed.                               
OL,17, "Aww thank you both so much, come in,  
OL,18, make yourselves at home in the lounge, 
OL,19, and I'll get some of this wine open!"  
OL,20, They weaved their way in, so many      
OL,21, polite pleasantries it was pained.

OL,6, "Something smells amazing!" Rach cried 
OL,7, through to the kitchen.                
OL,9, "He's such a great chef! I can burn    
OL,10, water trying to boil an egg!"          
OL,12, Max replied "My speciality pork with   
OL,13, crackling - learnt from the kitchen of 
OL,14, Josie Reynolds!"                       
OL,16, They all nodded approval, as Fiona     
OL,17, poured the wine, spilling a little with
OL,18, her nervous excitement.                
OL,20, Rachel looked her up and down, and     
OL,21, thought her a bit silly.

OL,6, They barely knew her, due to all of    
OL,7, their busy lives, and were intrigued to
OL,8, get to know her better.                
OL,10, Fiona was Jack's cousin, and that was  
OL,11, about all they knew. The fact that she 
OL,12, made Max happy and their relationship  
OL,13, seemed so happy was enough reason to be
OL,14, positive. Yet, Rachel did have a       
OL,15, shallow and snobby side to her, that   
OL,16, could creep up when faced with other   
OL,17, confident women.                       
OL,19, Rich, on the other hand, thought she   
OL,20, was much nicer than many of his other  
OL,21, girlfriends (there had been a lot!).

OL,6, He also thought she was a bit ditzy,   
OL,7, and harmless. Oh yes, and when it came 
OL,8, down to it, she was 'fit'!             
OL,10, "Not sure I've used the right glass for
OL,11, wine here, but down the hatch, eh      
OL,12, love!" Fiona screeched, and Rach shot  
OL,13, Rich a look.                           
OL,15, Max spotted the look from the kitchen, 
OL,16, but chose to ignore it. He'd never     
OL,17, thought Rachel was right for Rich, but 
OL,18, knew he had a blind spot when it came  
OL,19, to her.

OL,6, Rach sipped her wine -                 
OL,8, "Staying overnight with a friend of    
OL,9, mine. With his little best mate from   
OL,10, nursery, so she'll take them in        
OL,11, tomorrow, bless her. Our first night   
OL,12, without him!"                          
OL,14, Fiona cocked her head -                
OL,16, "Aww, little man, that does sound nice 
OL,17, though. Not staying with the           
OL,18, grandparents this time though?"        
OL,20, "No." Hackles were up, Rach didn't want
OL,21, to explain, and thought a line crossed.
