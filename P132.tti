OL,14, Laura was hysterical, in tears, as he

OL,16, couldn't help thinking that she was so 
OL,17, weak, controlling her will was going to

OL,6, The fire brigade were in the building, 
OL,7, hoses at the ready and the engine      
OL,8, growling into life, with a huge roar.  
OL,10, The street was lined with Alborford    
OL,11, residents, people coming out of houses,
OL,12, out of shops, and also gathering to    
OL,13, grab a look at what was going on.      
OL,15, There was a flurry of activity and it  
OL,16, wasn't long before it seemed the fire  
OL,17, had been put out, contained in a small 
OL,18, area downstairs in the back and one of 
OL,19, the back rooms.                        
OL,21, Ali appeared, gasping in horror.

OL,6, She was heading to the shops and       
OL,7, noticed the crowd and smoke.           
OL,9, "Darling, are you alright?"            
OL,11, "Oh, Mum! We discovered the fire, it's 
OL,12, so awful!" Laura collapsed on her Mum, 
OL,13, in floods of tears.                    
OL,15, "Are you okay?" She half glanced at    
OL,16, Nathan, who smiled at her in a sly way.
OL,18, "Yeah, just shocked, Nathan has been   
OL,19, amazing!"

OL,6, she said reluctantly.                  
OL,8, "Oh, you're very welcome!" They glared 
OL,9, at each other, Laura not even          
OL,10, realising.                             
OL,12, Interrupting their flow, other         
OL,13, emergency services had arrived, to take
OL,14, care of casualties...and stretchers    
OL,15, began to appear.                       
OL,17, An unconscious Lil Johnson was being   
OL,18, brought out of the pub.                
OL,20, "Oh no, Lil was in there too!" Ali     
OL,21, gasped, catching a glimpse of her.

OL,6, They'd been long time friends, Lil     
OL,7, always a familiar sight around town.   
OL,9, She was quickly followed by Jack and Jo
OL,10, being carried out of the pub too.      
OL,12, Jo seemed to be unconscious, with a    
OL,13, mask being placed over her face.       
OL,14, Paramedics went to attach the same to  
OL,15, Jack, but he was awake and talking.    
OL,17, "Jack! Are you alright?" Ali cried.    
OL,19, He looked over and smiled, lifting an  
OL,20, arm to wave.

OL,6, "Opening time might be later, you

OL,8, laughed...but everyone shocked by      
OL,9, events and the two unconscious women   
OL,10, heading to hospital, along with Jack.  
OL,12, "I think we need to get you home,      
OL,13, you've had such a nasty shock!" Ali    
OL,14, didn't want to let her daughter go.    
OL,16, "Nathan should come too please, he's   
OL,17, looked after me and been so amazing!"  
OL,19, Ali glared at him again, but couldn't  
OL,20, deny that, and softened when her       
OL,21, daughter was in tears on her shoulder.
