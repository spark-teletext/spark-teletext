OL,6, It was an hour before opening for

OL,6, Jack coughed from behind them.         
OL,8, "Not that he matches up to you, my

OL,11, "Yeah, I know!" They all laughed

OL,6, She spotted a couple of friends and    
OL,7, made small talk for a while, and then  
OL,8, spotted Laura and Nathan in the        
OL,9, distance.                              
OL,11, She almost called out to them, but     
OL,12, stopped herself when she noticed they  
OL,13, were deep in conversation. Walking     
OL,14, along hand in hand, and as the chat    
OL,15, intensified he seemed to grip her arm  
OL,16, tightly.                               
OL,18, They stopped, Laura leaning against a  
OL,19, wall, and Nathan looking red faced and 
OL,20, clearly having cross words. Ali looked 
OL,21, on, instantly feeling very concerned.
