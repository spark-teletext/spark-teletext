OL,14, Rhys had been knocking on the door of  
OL,15, Number Ten for a while, when James     
OL,16, eventually answered it.                
OL,18, "Steady on mate, am trying to sleep in 
OL,19, here!" He looked absolutely shattered, 
OL,20, after working all hours!

OL,6, "Oh, er, I'm sorry James. Is Cathy     
OL,7, here?"                                 
OL,8, James managed a smile at this          
OL,10, "Cathy! I think you'd better have a    
OL,11, word with this young man!"             
OL,13, Cathy appeared and quickly saw Rhys.   
OL,14, "Ah, yes, I think I should. Come in,   
OL,15, Rhys."                                 
OL,17, Jack had opened The Rose & Crown that  
OL,18, afternoon and Fiona was busy at work in
OL,19, the kitchen when Lil Johnson arrived   
OL,20, for her shift.

OL,6, "Alright, Lil?" Fiona was almost beside
OL,7, herself with excitement.               
OL,9, "Yes, darlin, well just look at you!   
OL,10, Getting on well with Max are we?"      
OL,12, "More than alright, Lil! He asked me to
OL,13, marry him and I said yes!" Fiona       
OL,14, flashed her engagement ring at Lil.    
OL,16, "Oh, that's fantastic news!" Lil flung 
OL,17, herself at Fiona and they hugged.      
OL,19, Jack walked in, carrying a sack of veg.

OL,6, "You've heard the news then?" He       
OL,7, laughed.                               
OL,9, Lil's gossipy nature came into play not

OL,12, "How's it gone down with the Reynolds?"
OL,14, Lil knew that Don and Josie probably   
OL,15, weren't the easiest parents in         
OL,16, Alborford, she'd come to blows with    
OL,17, them a few times, but she'd always had

OL,9, "Well, don't worry about her, love, as 
OL,10, long as you're happy with Max."        
OL,12, Fiona cooed as she started peeling     
OL,13, potatoes "Oh, I sure am!"              
OL,15, Back at Number Ten, Cathy was giving   
OL,16, Rhys quite a talking to.               
OL,18, "So, what do you think you're doing    
OL,19, coming here? Not very discreet!" Rhys

OL,6, "Time you were heading home yet, Rhys?"
OL,7, He smiled, knowingly. He didn't really 
OL,8, disapprove, but kept it simple for     
OL,9, Ros's sake and to save face with the   
OL,10, neighbours.                            
OL,12, Ali and Josie went out for a meal that 
OL,13, night in Norwich, and were chatting as 
OL,14, they often do about their children.    
OL,16, "Well, she's a nice enough girl, but   
OL,17, I'm not sure that she's good enough for
OL,18, Max!" Josie was getting quite animated 
OL,19, after a couple of wines.

OL,6, "Well, Max hasn't stayed with one girl 
OL,7, for this long before has he?" Ali      
OL,8, remarked.                              
OL,10, "No, he certainly hasn't! I suppose I  
OL,11, haven't had time to think about it     
OL,12, before, because nobody has ever been   
OL,13, this serious before...maybe I don't    
OL,14, think marriage is right for Max!"      
OL,16, "Well, he's at that age...most of us   
OL,17, were settled down by then in our day,  
OL,18, weren't we? Just look at Sam, he's in  
OL,19, limbo really?" Ali practically shouted,
OL,20, the wine going to her vocal chords now.
