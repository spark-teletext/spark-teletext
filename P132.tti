OL,15, "Hey, open up! Jack! Jo! Can you hear  
OL,16, me?" Nathan shouted through the        
OL,17, letterbox, he thought he could see     
OL,18, someone lying on the floor of the bar. 
OL,20, "The fire service should be on the     
OL,21, way!" Laura cried, banging on windows.

OL,6, Upstairs, Jack and Jo had pulled       
OL,7, clothes on, hearing the commotion and  
OL,8, gradually realising what was happening!
OL,10, "Oh my God, the bar downstairs, it must
OL,11, be there," Jack put his arms around Jo 
OL,12, and began to lead her to the door of   
OL,13, the bedroom.                           
OL,15, As they opened it, smoke billowed      
OL,16, towards them and they both ducked down 
OL,17, and choked and coughed.                
OL,19, "Oh! Help! What are we going to do?!"  
OL,20, Jo screamed, coughing more.

OL,6, Outside, as Nathan began shouldering   
OL,7, the door (in vain, it was such an old a
OL,8, sturdy door) and Laura thought about   
OL,9, smashing a window, Kris was walking    
OL,10, nearby.                                
OL,12, When she saw the smoke and heard the   
OL,13, noise, she dashed across the road      
OL,14, shouting, almost being hit by a bus in 
OL,15, the process.                           
OL,17, "Where's Jo?! JO! JO?!" She screamed at
OL,18, the top of her lungs, a blood curdling 
OL,19, and totally over the top cry.          
OL,21, She almost flung Laura to one side.

OL,6, Then she practically hissed at Nathan. 
OL,8, "Hurry up and get in there, you!"      
OL,10, Nathan sneered back at her.            
OL,12, "Have a go, if you think you can do    
OL,13, better?!"                              
OL,15, She grabbed him by the scruff of the   
OL,16, neck, almost wanting to kiss and hug   
OL,17, him.                                   
OL,19, "Help her! She could be dying in

OL,6, As she screeched, the fire engine      
OL,7, roared around the corner of the High   
OL,8, Street, sirens blaring, and skidded to 
OL,9, a halt even more suddenly.             
OL,11, A fireman descended and spoken to      
OL,12, Nathan first.                          
OL,14, "Have you had any response? Do you know

OL,6, And I think I saw someone on the floor,
OL,7, when I looked through the letterbox!"  
OL,9, Laura and Kris suddenly paid attention.
OL,11, "What the hell? Who else is in there?! 
OL,12, The person who lit the fire, no doubt! 
OL,13, Don't just stand there, get on with    
OL,14, it!" She shouted at the fireman.       
OL,16, He shot her a withering look and he and
OL,17, his colleagues entered the pub, smoke  
OL,18, pouring into the street and flames     
OL,19, licking the inner walls visible. The   
OL,20, trio stood gobsmacked.
