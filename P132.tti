OL,6, "This is amazing, mate, I've never seen
OL,7, the place doing so well!" Max hugged   
OL,8, Jack, as they shared a drink.

OL,6, Kris was drunk and getting emotional,  
OL,7, as she sat on a bar stool, almost      
OL,8, falling off several times.             
OL,10, "Thanks, Kris, you know I love ya! You 
OL,11, and Phil and the next house mate will  
OL,12, be doing just fine. And I'm always here
OL,13, for you, just because I'm with Jack,   
OL,14, doesn't mean I forget you," she held   
OL,15, her hand for a moment, knowing what an 
OL,16, insecure Kris would need to hear.      
OL,18, "Love you too.....another gin, mate,   
OL,19, it'll be midnight soon!"               
OL,21, Ros and Sam arrived late, after a meal.

OL,6, They decided to use the party as a way 
OL,7, of going public together, for those who
OL,8, didn't already know.                   
OL,10, There were a few nudges here and there,
OL,11, but in the main folk were quickly

OL,6, "He was a scumbag, treated me like dirt
OL,7, more than once. And I fancied him like
