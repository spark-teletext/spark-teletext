OL,6, "Not keen on seeing your family, are   
OL,7, you Cathy?" Ros chuckled.              
OL,9, "No, they're pretty useless aren't     
OL,10, they, Ros? You know this, you come from
OL,11, a nice family who treated you like they

OL,6, Cathy had a habit of staring intently  
OL,7, at everyone she spoke to at the best of
OL,8, times, but the intensity was even more 
OL,9, so now.                                
OL,11, Ros tried desperately to not look      
OL,12, guilty as hell, as she replied.        
OL,14, "They sure did! Anyone would think I   
OL,15, was the guilty party! I may not have   
OL,16, seen eye to eye with him many a time,  
OL,17, but want him gone? Never, I love him!" 
OL,19, Cathy seemed convinced, she thought,   
OL,20, rather than realising she wanted the   
OL,21, scumbag dead, and despised him.

OL,6, Years of his shenanigans saw to that!  
OL,8, "It's one of his scams, love, I'm sure 
OL,9, of it! He's been up to something even  
OL,10, you know nothing about! He's had shady 
OL,11, dealings before hasn't he?" Cathy      
OL,12, poured more wine, licking her lips she 
OL,13, was talking so fast.                   
OL,15, "Yes of course, I knew some of that..."
OL,17, "There was a lot more than you knew,   
OL,18, Ros, you poor cow," I know a damn sight

OL,6, Up to his neck in it with a gang or    
OL,7, something, pushing it with his charm,  
OL,8, thinking that would see him through yet
OL,9, again! He's probably been bumped off,  
OL,10, or scared off. I reckon the police know
OL,11, this too!"                             
OL,13, Ros tried her best not to smile, this  
OL,14, was going perfectly, so much better    
OL,15, than she could have hoped for.         
OL,17, Cathy had always taken James side      
OL,18, against her, but the tables had turned 
OL,19, at long last! Perfect, she couldn't    
OL,20, wait to see how this panned out...then 
OL,21, she could finally be happy with Sam.

OL,6, For Sam's sake, it was to be a         
OL,7, blessing, because he had been a nervous
OL,8, wreck since it all started. He was     
OL,9, permanently distracted and worried sick
