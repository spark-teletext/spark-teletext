OL,7,Fspent the day together, the anniversary

OL,15, At Number Ten, Ros opened the door     
OL,16, tentatively, in case James had come    
OL,17, back.                                  
OL,19, "Come in!" It was Sam, and they kissed 
OL,20, passionately in the doorway, as the    
OL,21, door slammed behind him.

OL,6, Alborford's Christmas lights were      
OL,7, twinkling, and Nathan and Laura        
OL,8, wandered hand in hand through town.    
OL,10, "Something tells me your family aren't 
OL,11, going to welcome me with open arms this
OL,12, Christmas! I don't expect it though,"  
OL,13, Nathan couldn't care less, but went    
OL,14, through the motions of pretending to be
OL,15, who she wanted him to be. If that meant
OL,16, playing happy families, so be it!      
OL,18, "I know babe, but even if it can't     
OL,19, happen, we can still ensure we spend   
OL,20, plenty of time together can't we?"

OL,6, Back at Number Ten, Sam and Ros laid in
OL,7, bed, wrapped around each other.        
OL,9, "Amazing, darling, talk about playing  
OL,10, him at his own game!" Sam laughed,     
OL,11, after Ros recounted her blessing       
OL,12, earlier that evening.                  
OL,14, "I know, I figured this long game needs
OL,15, to take a different turn. You helped me
OL,16, see that. There's part of me that still
OL,17, loves James, but knowing that he will  
OL,18, never change - especially after the    
OL,19, discovery of children - something has  
OL,20, snapped in me now. It's time to figure 
OL,21, out what I want...

OL,6, ...and I think my love for you is      
OL,7, something else!"                       
OL,9, Sam sipped a drink and turned to her.  
OL,11, "So you want to go ahead with what we  
OL,12, discussed?" Sam asked, still a little  
OL,13, unsure himself.                        
OL,15, "Yes I do - we should see each other in
OL,16, secret, sneak around like he...used to.
OL,17, Then, when he thinks I truly love him  
OL,18, and accept all of this with Clare, I   
OL,19, will publicly humiliate him, take his

OL,6, James, meanwhile, was in bed with      
OL,7, Clare.                                 
OL,9, "Yes, it's amazing, she actually gives 
OL,10, us her blessing!"                      
OL,12, Clare rolled her eyes.                 
OL,14, "She's faking, think about it James!   
OL,15, She's only pretending to do that, I    
OL,16, think she is up to something?!" James  
OL,17, didn't believe that, Clare didn't      
OL,18, really know either of them. One of his 
OL,19, failings, he often took Ros at face    
OL,20, value and underestimated her!

OL,6, Ali and Josie took a trip to the       
OL,7, supermarket, which was heaving.        
OL,9, "This is crazy, so many people, I      
OL,10, haven't even got the turkey yet!" Josie
OL,11, almost shouted above the festive music 
OL,12, and people chatter.                    
OL,14, "Better get it today then, love! I've  
OL,15, got to stock up on snacks and all the  
OL,16, post Christmas buffet for family       
OL,17, visiting. Booze free this year of      
OL,18, course! The rest of us will have to    
OL,19, support Paul in that!" She felt        
OL,20, nervous, as Josie heaved turkeys,      
OL,21, hoping this would be a happy season!
