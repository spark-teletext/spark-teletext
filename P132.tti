OL,14, Jack and Jo were back in the Rose &    
OL,15, Crown and beginning the task of        
OL,16, completing clean up ahead of repairs,  
OL,17, and the insurance assessors were       
OL,18, visiting too.                          
OL,20, "It doesn't seem too bad damage wise,  
OL,21, thank goodness," Jack sighed.

OL,6, The pub was his baby and had been his  
OL,7, whole life for some time, and he felt  
OL,8, so upset, seeing the damaged side bar  
OL,9, and a couple of store rooms.           
OL,11, It could have been so much worse       
OL,12, though, and such an old building in    
OL,13, Alborford's history could have been    
OL,14, lost.                                  
OL,16, "And they've found the cause?" Jo      
OL,17, asked, hugging him tightly.            
OL,19, "It was a cigarette..."                
OL,21, "Lil! I hope you're going to...."

OL,9, "And taken us and the pub with her!    
OL,10, Silly old cow!"                        
OL,12, Jack felt defensive.                   
OL,14, "Alright, Jo! It was an accident and   
OL,15, she will no doubt be horrified! And Lil
OL,16, has been like a second Mum to me, she

OL,6, He would instantly forgive her this    
OL,7, misjudgement.                          
OL,9, Easter arrived in Alborford and Richard
OL,10, and Rach were taking Harry to an Easter
OL,11, egg hunt with nursery friends and their
OL,12, children. He giggled, toddling around  
OL,13, the park, as they both looked on,      
OL,14, beaming.                               
OL,16, "Thank goodness Jack, Jo and Lil are

OL,6, "First good thing I've heard of Nathan 
OL,7, Cameron doing, that's for sure," she   
OL,8, reached for Harry, as he tried to make 
OL,9, a break for it and run off too far.    
OL,11, Out of the corner of her eye, she      
OL,12, suddenly spotted Ros and Sam, walking  
OL,13, together on the other side of the park.
OL,15, She tried not to let Richard realise   
OL,16, who she had seen, the fewer people     
OL,17, aware the better. Ros had confided in  
OL,18, her that their affair had resumed, but 
OL,19, she never expected them to be seen out 
OL,20, together.

OL,6, Ros, on the other hand, couldn't care  
OL,7, less about being seen with Sam, when   
OL,8, James was publicly carrying on with    
OL,9, Clare now.                             
OL,11, They weren't hand in hand, but         
OL,12, nevertheless looking like a couple.    
OL,14, "Were you really serious about what you
OL,15, said...about bumping off James? You    
OL,16, can't have been?!" Sam asked, scared of
OL,17, the reply.                             
OL,19, Ros laughed, and looked at him         
OL,20, intensely. The laugh made him expect a 
OL,21, denial, but that wasn't what followed.
