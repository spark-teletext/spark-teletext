OL,6, Last week on Rex Road: Another student 
OL,7, house interview, with cocky Ben Walker,
OL,8, didn't go so well! Lisa and Nathan     
OL,9, split up and she left Alborford.       
OL,11, EPISODE NINETY FOUR                    
OL,13, "Another day, another interviewee!"    
OL,14, Kris cried, running down the stairs    
OL,15, towards Jo.                            
OL,17, "Yes indeed, this time a Dan Morgan?   
OL,18, Aged thirty and a mature               
OL,19, student...interesting," Jo leafed      
OL,20, through paperwork, as the doorbell     
OL,21, rang.

OL,6, "Talk of the devil!"                   
OL,7, James was outside the office, sat in   
OL,8, his car with his latest fling, an      
OL,9, office junior called Clare.            
OL,11, "I've booked a hotel for Saturday, even
OL,12, if we can't stay over, we've got the   
OL,13, use of it for a while!" James excitedly
OL,14, chatted, then kissed her.              
OL,16, "Can't wait, James, can't believe I'm  
OL,17, doing this - always said I would never 
OL,18, get involved with a married man!" Clare
OL,19, stated, in an embarrassed whisper.

OL,6, "Well, you made an exception for me,   
OL,7, you obviously can't resist my charms!" 
OL,8, He laughed, kissing her again, and then
OL,9, spotted Ros in the distance, walking   
OL,10, and chatting with Rach.                
OL,12, He almost jumped through the roof of   
OL,13, the car.                               
OL,15, "What on Earth, what's wrong?! Oh...is 
OL,16, that her, over there?"                 
OL,18, James nodded, almost shrinking down    
OL,19, into the seat as far as he could.

OL,7, play away like you do! Does she know   
OL,8, what you get up to?"                   
OL,9, "She does more these days...kind of an

OL,12, Clare cocked her head in curiosity.    
OL,14, "Kind of?"                             
OL,16, The interview was going well at Number 
OL,17, Six.                                   
OL,18, "So then Dan, what made you want to go 
OL,19, back into study, I'm surprised you     
OL,20, didn't go into modelling?" Kris asked, 
OL,21, stunned by his good looks.

OL,6, He blushed with embarrassment.         
OL,7, "Thank you, well, I flunked the first  
OL,8, time around, too busy having a good    
OL,9, time! I want to retrain in             
OL,10, engineering!"                          
OL,12, "Good with your hands, are you?" Jo    
OL,13, laughed, making everybody giggle. Even 
OL,14, though she was seeing Jack, she could  
OL,15, see the appeal herself!                
OL,17, Dan shifted uneasily, wondering if this
OL,18, was all a bit full on for him!         
OL,20, Later, at Number Ten, Ros and James sat

OL,6, "Good day at the office?" Ros asked,   
OL,7, serving up.                            
OL,9, "Yeah thanks, pretty run of the mill
