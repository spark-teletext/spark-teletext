OL,6, The cow!" Rach was getting Harry ready 
OL,7, to go out for the day, and still       
OL,8, smarted from her encounter with her    
OL,9, neighbour. She was feeling over        
OL,10, sensitive, after Rich's determined     
OL,11, chats about child number two, and it   
OL,12, was coming out in ways like this.      
OL,14, "Alright, love, I don't think you need

OL,6, In fact, probably enough packed up for 
OL,7, about ten families!                    
OL,9, The weather had been kind to them      
OL,10, though, and Rachel noticed that Rich   
OL,11, was in a blissful like state these     
OL,12, days.

OL,17, Why did they have to disrupt it?
