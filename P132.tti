OL,12, "Yes, hello Sam," Jimmy walked towards

OL,14, Sam walked away ignoring it.

OL,8, "Well, it did upset her, but I'd say

OL,10, student that was living in his         
OL,11, brother's flat, standing talking to Ros
OL,12, on the doorstep.                       
OL,14, "Yeah, take these books for as long as 
OL,15, you like, I'm sure they'll help with
