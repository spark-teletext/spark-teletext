OL,8,Fspending the night with Jo; Ros was    
OL,9,Ftorn in two over her feelings for both

OL,17, subtle and caring as ever.             
OL,19, "Well, this isn't about you - for a    
OL,20, change! I don't think any woman has got
OL,21, close to him since his wife died.

OL,6, That's the point, I think he is now    
OL,7, feeling very uncomfortable about it -  
OL,8, as if he has betrayed her! How do I    
OL,9, compete with the memory of a dead      
OL,10, woman?!"                               
OL,12, "You really like him that much? You've 
OL,13, only just split with Mike!"            
OL,15, "You're one to call me out on speed!   
OL,16, Yes I do like him that much....kind of 
OL,17, always carried a torch!"               
OL,19, Meanwhile, Jack and Max had a chat as

OL,6, "I feel like I've betrayed Cassie mate,
OL,7, and not sure whether the feelings are  
OL,8, there or not until I resolve the       
OL,9, guilt!"                                
OL,11, Max shrugged - "Not sure I can help you
OL,12, with that one. In the whole time I have
OL,13, known you, you've not allowed another  
OL,14, woman to get close to you...I think    
OL,15, you're being too hard on yourself      
OL,16, though. Cassie would want you to be    
OL,17, happy, mate, don't you think?"         
OL,19, Jack lugged a box of mixers onto the   
OL,20, shelves, as he looked deep in thought.
