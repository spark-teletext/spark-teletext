OL,18, "This is so good, these new owners have

OL,20, enthused, through mouthfuls of bacon

OL,9, "I think I'm going to start doing the  
OL,10, same, maybe bri..." he stopped himself 
OL,11, suddenly blurting out her name.        
OL,13, "Ha! Bring Ros? I knew it! You're      
OL,14, seeing her again, aren't you?" Max knew
OL,15, his brother too well to be deceived!   
OL,17, "Okay, yeah I am, but don't tell       
OL,18, anyone! I'll kill you if you do!" Sam  
OL,19, smiled, and killing is definitely      
OL,20, something he wasn't going to talk about
OL,21, today. His mind was in a spin.

OL,6, He wondered if Ros had lost her mind,  
OL,7, if he should break it off, he wondered 
OL,8, all manner of things.                  
OL,10, "Don't worry, your sordid little secret
OL,11, is safe. I've known James long enough  
OL,12, to know that he probably deserves      
OL,13, everything he gets. He doesn't even    
OL,14, hide his affairs now, I don't know why 
OL,15, he doesn't just leave," he ranted,     
OL,16, stuffing sausage into toast wrapping.  
OL,18, "He and Ros do have some weird hold    
OL,19, over each other. I still hope I can

OL,8, "Time to cut the apron strings on that

OL,10, Fiona laughing louder.                 
OL,12, "You can talk! You're still running

OL,6, James and Clare were lying in a hotel  
OL,7, bed in London, after a business trip   
OL,8, the day before.                        
OL,10, "I've been thinking...we've spent so   
OL,11, much time together lately, it's been   
OL,12, wonderful!"                            
OL,14, "It sure has, babe, I know I've been   
OL,15, loving it too!"                        
OL,17, She bit the bullet.                    
OL,19, "I love you, James," she kissed him    
OL,20, passionately, and he almost froze.

OL,6, "I want us to be together all the time,
OL,7, I think you should leave Ros, it's     
OL,8, time. Don't you agree?" The effect was 
OL,9, almost instant. Yes, he cared for      
OL,10, Clare, but didn't want to leave Ros.   
OL,11, James enjoyed the power trip too much, 
OL,12, leading women a merry dance. And Clare 
OL,13, had instantly ruined it.               
OL,15, Little did James know, Ros at that     
OL,16, moment was on her way to discuss his   
OL,17, death with some very shady contacts in 
OL,18, Norwich. She sat on the train and      
OL,19, smiled to herself, looking forward to  
OL,20, being free of him soon.
