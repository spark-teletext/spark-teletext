OL,10, "Oh yeah, of course, and I still love

OL,6, He was feeling sensitive, having too   
OL,7, much time to think about the missing   
OL,8, James Porter. The dead James Porter.   
OL,9, Nobody seemed to care at all, except   
OL,10, him, about a killing!                  
OL,12, Josie suddenly mentioned him too, their
OL,13, thoughts aligned. Sam had confided in  
OL,14, the family about seeing Ros again, not 
OL,15, that they were happy about it.         
OL,17, "James Porter, I wonder what he's doing

OL,9, Alborford Christmas lights twinkled,   
OL,10, the tree standing proud near the Rose  
OL,11, and Crown, as Ali and Paul decided to

OL,6, Speaking of challenges, I know he's    
OL,7, improved, but how much longer are we   
OL,8, going to be hosting Mr Cameron? Any

OL,6, Sam smiled uneasily, wanting to scream 
OL,7, and shout, to tell her that he couldn't
OL,8, cope with the truth...but he dare not. 
OL,10, "I love the bracelet you got me for    
OL,11, Christmas, babes, it's so pretty!" She
