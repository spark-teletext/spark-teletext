OL,6, Last week on Rex Road: Complex love    
OL,7, issues, Jo seemed uneasy about her     
OL,8, engagement, Fiona made grand plans, and
OL,9, Nathan played a dangerous game juggling
OL,10, Lisa and Laura.                        
OL,12, EPISODE EIGHTY SEVEN                   
OL,14, Jack opened the doors, to let Jo in for
OL,15, her evening shift.                     
OL,17, "You're only five minutes late, that   
OL,18, makes a pleasant change, Jo!" He       
OL,19, laughed, teasing her as he often did.

OL,6, Jo walked in silently and started      
OL,7, taking chairs off tables.              
OL,9, "Are you alright?" Jack asked.         
OL,11, Suddenly, she burst into tears and     
OL,12, collapsed down on one of the chairs.   
OL,14, "What on Earth's wrong, darlin'? Has   
OL,15, something happened with Mike?"         
OL,17, Jo started sobbing on his shoulder.    
OL,19, "The engagement's off, he dumped me! I 
OL,20, feel such a fool!"

OL,6, "Where's Cathy this morning?" Ros asked
OL,7, James, hugging and kissing him before  
OL,8, sitting down for breakfast.            
OL,10, "She stayed at a friend's last night - 
OL,11, and who cares when you're being        
OL,12, affectionate, darling?" James glared at
OL,13, her intently. Their relationship had   
OL,14, been strained for weeks, Ros being     
OL,15, distant and struggling to forgive him  
OL,16, for the dramatic revelations of the    
OL,17, past.                                  
OL,19, "You're pleased that I am then, you    
OL,20, still want me to be?" Ros asked.

OL,6, "Of course I do, I love you. I just    
OL,7, want us to be like we used to be. Do   
OL,8, you think we can?"                     
OL,10, Ros kissed him.                        
OL,12, "Yes, yes am sure we can," she         
OL,13, struggled, she was not convinced,      
OL,14, forcing herself to be positive. Ros had
OL,15, some serious soul searching to do.     
OL,17, "The thing is James, there have been   
OL,18, other women and you even have children 
OL,19, now. When is it going to be just us?"  
OL,21, "Or us and our child?"

OL,6, She didn't respond to that.            
OL,8, "We've always got through these things 
OL,9, before haven't we. You know how it is, 
OL,10, there are no guarantees in life," he   
OL,11, smiled and winked at her. Even now, he 
OL,12, wanted a licence to still have flings. 
OL,13, Nothing had changed.                   
OL,15, Back in the Rose & Crown, Jack consoled
OL,16, a tearful Jo.                          
OL,18, "What the hell happened with Mike? I   
OL,19, don't even know the guy, but put me in 
OL,20, the picture, mate?" Everybody knew Jo  
OL,21, had rushed into this, but didn't say.

OL,6, "I think he's played me Jack, I thought
OL,7, he was the one, but he's like James    
OL,8, Porter - am just the latest in a long  
OL,9, line of gullible women! He ditched me  
OL,10, and the next day, I see him out with   
OL,11, another woman!" She dissolved into     
OL,12, floods of tears onto his shoulder.     
OL,14, "Oh Jo, I'm so sorry!"                 
OL,16, "What is wrong with me, Jack? I can't  
OL,17, seem to keep any bloke, something      
OL,18, always puts them off?! Can you see what
OL,19, they see?"                             
OL,21, Jack looked into her tear filled eyes.

OL,6, "You're lovely, Jo, I've always thought
OL,7, that," he found himself opening up for 
OL,8, the first time in a while.             
OL,10, "Ever since Cassie, I've tried not to  
OL,11, look at women in that way...but trust  
OL,12, me, there's nothing wrong with you at

OL,19, "Thanks mate, you're really kind," and 
OL,20, with that she planted a kiss on his
