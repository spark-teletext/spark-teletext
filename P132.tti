OL,14, Many Alborford residents were gathered

OL,16, Sunday, a grey and chilly morning.     
OL,18, "I've not seen Arthur Bates for a      
OL,19, while, so lovely to chat to him        
OL,20, earlier," Josie turned to Don, looking 
OL,21, over at her war veteran friend.

OL,6, Don smiled, and held her hand.         
OL,8, "He's a lovely old chap, we ought to go
OL,9, over sometime and make sure he's got   
OL,10, everything he needs. I mean, I know he 
OL,11, has family, but every little extra     
OL,12, helping hand may be useful!"           
OL,14, "You're right, love, that would be the 
OL,15, right thing to do. Days like today     
OL,16, remind me of looking after that        
OL,17, generation. We owe them everything,    
OL,18, it's so important..."                  
OL,20, Ali and Paul Lucas were also there,    
OL,21, having passed by on their way out.

OL,6, "The band are going to march through   
OL,7, soon, then the silence at 11am. I'm    
OL,8, glad we stopped now, easy to forget the
OL,9, important things and just go about the 
OL,10, everyday trivial rubbish," Ali said,   
OL,11, with an arm round him, feeling chilly. 
OL,13, "Oh yes, you're right there. I still   
OL,14, want to get my lunch after this though,
OL,15, am starving and there's nothing in!"   
OL,17, Ali squeezed him, to will him to shut

OL,6, "Nathan has to go, you know, he's been

OL,6, Laura and Nathan walked by moments     
OL,7, later.                                 
OL,9, "Your folks are there, they're supposed
OL,10, to be at the supermarket, getting our  
OL,11, lunch!" Nathan remarked.               
OL,13, "Honestly Nath, don't worry about it,  
OL,14, am sure they'll get it sorted, stop    
OL,15, making a fuss over nothing," Laura felt
OL,16, tired and grumpy that morning, she     
OL,17, hadn't woken up properly.              
OL,19, "What did you say? Fuss over nothing!" 
OL,20, He twisted her wrist, as they held     
OL,21, hands, instantly losing his temper.

OL,6, "Ow, you're hurting me, stop," Laura   
OL,7, cried, wincing.                        
OL,9, "And you're going to get a lot more of 
OL,10, that, if you're keep talking to me that
OL,11, way. I've noticed you're getting braver
OL,12, lately, asserting your authority.      
OL,13, Probably because we're living in your
