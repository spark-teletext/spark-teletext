OL,6, "Keep calm, you're going to have to if 
OL,7, your plan is going to work - or he will
OL,8, suspect!" She quickly cooled down and  
OL,9, kissed him - they were snatching a     
OL,10, couple of hours before James returned  
OL,11, from work..IF he returned on time of   
OL,12, course.

OL,20, take?

OL,6, Rachel cuddled Harry, as Richard       
OL,7, finished talking to his family on the  
OL,8, phone.                                 
OL,10, "They all wish you Happy New Year -    
OL,11, said how much they loved seeing you!"  
OL,12, For the first time, Rach had felt truly
OL,13, welcomed by his family, and many of her
OL,14, old insecurities melted away.          
OL,16, "That's nice! Oh, I need to open up the
OL,17, salon tomorrow, wish this holiday could
OL,18, go on forever!" She whined, grabbing   
OL,19, him for a cuddle with both her boys.   
OL,21, Jack and Jo enjoyed dinner together.

OL,6, They were due to open the pub shortly, 
OL,7, and had spent much of Christmas        
OL,8, together. Jack had finally put his     
OL,9, worries aside and told himself that    
OL,10, Cassie would want him to be happy...   
OL,11, feeling that his life could move       
OL,12, forward now.                           
OL,14, "Mum and Dad have asked about meeting  
OL,15, you? Would you like to soon, was       
OL,16, wondering about one weekend?" Jo       
OL,17, nervously asked, being careful not to  
OL,18, push her luck, as natural as it felt to
OL,19, ask now.                               
OL,21, Jack smiled to himself, then to her -

OL,6, "Sure, let's do it! I've held back for 
OL,7, too long, time to start living now.    
OL,8, Thank you for such a great Christmas,  
OL,9, the first one I have enjoyed at all for
OL,10, a while," Jack leant over to kiss her, 
OL,11, almost interrupted by a knock at door. 
OL,13, "Someone always turns up early,        
OL,14, desperate for those New Year pints!"   
OL,15, They laughed, knowing their private    
OL,16, time was over for now, but neither had 
OL,17, felt so happy in a long time - and     
OL,18, wanted to shout it from the rooftops.  
OL,20, Kris served up dinner for Phil.

OL,11, both of them had luck in love," Phil
