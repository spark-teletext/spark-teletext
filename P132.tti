OL,6, Last week, on Rex Road: Fiona felt     
OL,7, she'd found the family life she'd      
OL,8, craved; Phil announced he was leaving  
OL,9, Alborford, for a work transfer to      
OL,10, Colchester; Cathy visited, annoying    
OL,11, Ros, immediately asking James for      
OL,12, financial help.                        
OL,14, EPISODE EIGHTY FOUR                    
OL,16, Kris was back at home.                 
OL,18, "A new start for all of us I reckon!"  
OL,19, Jo made an over enthusiastic toast.    
OL,21, "Cheers," Kris said coyly,

OL,6, raising her orange juice, she couldn't 
OL,7, drink yet because of her medication.   
OL,9, "And new pastures coming up for you,   
OL,10, Phil, off to Colchester my boy!" Phil  
OL,11, frowned slightly at Jo's cheeky banter,
OL,12, but soon regained his composure. They'd
OL,13, agonised over whether to tell Kris yet,
OL,14, but thought honesty was the best policy
OL,15, from now on.                           
OL,17, "Yeah, lots to prepare before I can go 
OL,18, of course."

OL,6, Phil panicked.                         
OL,8, "Oh no, not for a couple of months I   
OL,9, should think, lots to do, and I may

OL,12, Phil and Jo were beginning to realise

OL,14, right now...and would their friend ever
OL,15, be the same again at all?

OL,6, you won't get rid of me that easily!"  
OL,8, Nathan and Lisa were walking through   
OL,9, the centre of Norwich, fighting their  
OL,10, way through the sales.                 
OL,12, "Oh, I've had enough of this!" Nathan  
OL,13, shouted after her, as she squeezed     
OL,14, through the doorway of a shop.         
OL,16, "This'll be it, we'll go to a pub after

OL,6, Minutes later, they were having that   
OL,7, drink and were getting pretty lovey    
OL,8, dovey in the corner.                   
OL,10, "It's been great few weeks, spending   
OL,11, all this time with you," Lisa cooed.   
OL,13, "Yeah, Max and Fiona have only         
OL,14, interrupted us a few times!"

OL,6, Nathan was pleased, his ego well and   
OL,7, truly boosted, but something inside him
OL,8, recoiled, when he sensed that he was   
OL,9, getting trapped. At that very moment,  
OL,10, he spotted Laura walking past.         
OL,12, "Are you alright?"                     
OL,14, "Er, yeah, fine," thankfully she kept  
OL,15, going and didn't look.                 
OL,17, Cathy decided to take a risk and knock 
OL,18, on the door of Number Eight, she was   
OL,19, pretty sure that nobody was at home
