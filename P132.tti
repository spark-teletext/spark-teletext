OL,14, bar, their first meeting since the     
OL,15, fire, with both of them still          
OL,16, recovering too. Lil occasionally       
OL,17, coughed as she spoke, dressings        
OL,18, covering burns on her arms.            
OL,20, "I don't know how I'm going to make it

OL,6, Jack took her hand. She really was like
OL,7, a second Mum to him, supporting him    
OL,8, over the years.                        
OL,10, "You don't need to fret, Lil. You've   
OL,11, done so much for me over the years,    
OL,12, helping me more than my own family     
OL,13, have. You helped me so much when Cassie
OL,14, died, I'll never forget that!"         
OL,16, She looked down at her coffee mug.     
OL,18, "And this is how I help you now, trying
OL,19, to burn down your pub! What will others
OL,20, think of me, what about Jo?"

OL,10, and Jo were chatting about the fire, as
OL,11, Phil was cooking dinner in the kitchen.
OL,13, "Yep, and I'm having a hard time coming
OL,14, to terms with that, and Jack's attitude
OL,15, to her," Jo hesitated saying it,       
OL,16, knowing how Kris would react.

OL,6, "I think you need to respect that Lil

OL,6, Sam and Ros were at a country pub near 
OL,7, Hamborough, enjoying a romantic dinner 
OL,8, whilst James was away. The inevitable  
OL,9, subject came up again.                 
OL,11, "You haven't told me the plan yet," Sam
OL,12, asked, genuinely frightened about what 
OL,13, may be happening next.                 
OL,15, Ros toyed with her food and smiled.    
OL,17, "Okay, I don't want to have to involve 
OL,18, you too much. I know a couple of       
OL,19, business people, through James         
OL,20, ironically. People he has crossed in   
OL,21, the past, and they are dodgy!

OL,9, "And they would do it?"                
OL,11, "Yes, they have got rid of people

OL,13, same work for me, at a reduced rate
