OL,14, Josie and Don were sitting in the

OL,16, the last of the evening sunshine.      
OL,18, "I'm liking the Commonwealth Games,    
OL,19, getting pretty hooked on that already,

OL,21, white wine to his wife.

OL,6, "Thanks lovie, hmm not really into it  
OL,7, myself! I miss Wimbledon! Anyway, how  
OL,8, nice is this weather, really hope it's 
OL,9, going to last, am soaking it up!" She  
OL,10, had always loved the hot summers in    
OL,11, Norfolk, and any chance for a holiday  
OL,12, to catch some rays.                    
OL,14, "Like the Maldives all over again!" Don
OL,15, added.                                 
OL,17, "Well, not quite haha! I'd like to see

OL,20, Yarmouth beach just outside perhaps!"

OL,6, "I know, I know..but there is something
OL,7, special about Norfolk during a hot     
OL,8, summer, isn't there?" Don smiled, and  
OL,9, they had shared so many together, and  
OL,10, to this day he never wanted to be      
OL,11, anywhere other than right here with    
OL,12, her.                                   
OL,14, "Yes, that's very true! Although there 
OL,15, and here we get to worry about our boys
OL,16, don't we! Do you detect something going
OL,17, on with Sam at the moment?"

OL,6, "Oh please?! Come on man, surely you're
OL,7, not totally oblivious?!" She rolled her
OL,8, eyes at him and sneered.               
OL,10, "I genuinely don't know what you mean? 
OL,11, He seems okay, he's working hard and   
OL,12, going out with his mates, like he      
OL,13, should be! Good for him!"              
OL,15, Josie put the glass down loudly, in

OL,6, Clare was alone in her flat, drinking  
OL,7, wine, thinking about the grilling she  
OL,8, had had from the police - which seemed 
OL,9, to go around in circles and leading to 
OL,10, nothing.                               
OL,12, She had her mobile phone back, and     
OL,13, scrolled through the messages she'd    
OL,14, kept from James.                       
OL,16, She'd just treated the affair, as he   
OL,17, had, as just casual fun - and never got
OL,18, involved enough to have strong feelings
OL,19, develop for him. Now though, she was   
OL,20, desperate to see him. What had happened
OL,21, to him?!
