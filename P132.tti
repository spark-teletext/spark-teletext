OL,6, "Aha! Hargreaves, J.M., 36 Collins Way,
OL,7, Hamborough." Josie nodded again,       
OL,8, realising that he still lived in the   
OL,9, same house.                            
OL,11, After a bit of persuasion, Josie       
OL,12, dialled the number, and a familiar     
OL,13, voice, though weathered by age and     
OL,14, cigarettes answered the phone.         
OL,16, "Jimmy? It's Josie,Josie Reynolds."    
OL,17, A few days later, Josie was on her way 
OL,18, to Jimmy Hargreaves house in           
OL,19, Hamborough. Don had reluctantly let her
OL,20, go alone, after realising that he would
OL,21, have started a fight otherwise.

OL,6, Josie knocked on the door and he opened
OL,7, it almost straight away.               
OL,9, "Josie! Come in!" He smiled at her and 
OL,10, she noticed straight away that he      
OL,11, hadn't aged too much over the          
OL,12, years...and he thought the same about  
OL,13, her.                                   
OL,15, He motioned for them to sit down in the
