OL,6,CLast time, on Rex Road:FAli told Josie 
OL,7,Fher concerns about Nathan, and they    
OL,8,Fagreed Paul may fall off the wagon;    
OL,9,FSam's pleas to Ros fell on deaf ears,  
OL,10,Fas she revealed James' gangster links.

OL,14, One week to go. Sam couldn't sleep,    
OL,15, knowing what was to come and counting  
OL,16, down in his mind, day by day. He'd had 
OL,17, nightmares when he did sleep, waking up
OL,18, in a sweat.                            
OL,20, Should he go to the police? How could  
OL,21, he do that? Ros would go down for this.

OL,6, Yet, she may go down for it anyway? And
OL,7, he may be taken down with her?         
OL,9, Sam was trapped in a nightmare, he     
OL,10, never signed up for this, what the hell
OL,11, would he do?!                          
OL,13, That evening, it seems as though Ali's 
OL,14, fears may be confirmed soon, as Paul   
OL,15, was alone in the house, with Nathan's  
OL,16, alcohol stash for company. He opened   
OL,17, the cupboards and looked at it several 
OL,18, times, even picking up the bottles and 
OL,19, staring intently - only to be          
OL,20, interrupted by Ali returning home.

OL,6, "What are you doing?" She asked,       
OL,7, nervously.                             
OL,9, "Just looking for some seasoning, I    
OL,10, wanted to make you a nice chilli       
OL,11, tonight - does that sound good?"       
OL,13, Ali didn't believe a word, but went    
OL,14, along with it this time, she didn't    
OL,15, want to confront the issue just yet,   
OL,16, when there was nothing to do...or was  
OL,17, there, how could she prevent the       
OL,18, inevitable, without making Paul feel   
OL,19, like he was being accused?!            
OL,21, Paul, at the same time, felt so guilty.

OL,6, Ros met up with the bosses, to make the
OL,7, final arrangements for next week.      
OL,9, "So how are you going to do it?        
OL,10, Novichok style poisoning? Stabbing?    
OL,11, Shooting?" She asked, with a wry smile.
OL,13, "I don't think poisoning is our style  
OL,14, somehow," he hissed.                   
OL,16, "Shooting is a possible, but a bit too 
OL,17, public. We were thinking that if you   
OL,18, can ensure he is in the right place, at
OL,19, the right time, we can kidnap him and  
OL,20, bring him back here..."

OL,9, "Why do you need to know? We have beef

OL,11, is also one of our choosing, we want to
OL,12, make him suffer. It won't be quick, Mrs

OL,19, He deserves everything he has coming!" 
OL,20, Ros spat her venom, like a woman

OL,6, Sam knew what he had to do now. He was 
OL,7, going to try to put her off, and hoped 
OL,8, that it wouldn't be too late.          
OL,10, There was no way he could go along with
OL,11, this, James was many things, but he    
OL,12, didn't deserve to die over it!         
OL,14, Although, what Ros had said frightened 
OL,15, him, it sounded as though they would   
OL,16, die if they tried to get away from him 
OL,17, forever.                               
OL,19, Maybe he should leave Alborford, leave 
OL,20, the woman he loves to her mad plans,   
OL,21, and get away from the whole mess?!
