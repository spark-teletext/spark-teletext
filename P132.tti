OL,6,CLast time on Rex Road:Fthe residents   
OL,7,Forganised a street party for the       
OL,8,FPlatinum Jubilee, culminating in Ros's 
OL,9,Fplan coming together - and James

OL,15, Sam woke up next to Ros, in Number Ten,
OL,16, for the first time in a while.         
OL,18, "I feel free, you know, it's just      
OL,19, incredible!" She yawned and stretched, 
OL,20, folding her arms around him.

OL,6, He felt so uneasy, in the few days     
OL,7, since events unfolded, Sam felt like a 
OL,8, criminal himself and they had crept    
OL,9, around - yet slept in the same bed too 
OL,10, wherever possible. The Porter marital  
OL,11, bed.                                   
OL,13, "Are the police coming back again yet?"
OL,14, Sam asked. After the party, and James  
OL,15, never returning from going to buy      
OL,16, drinks, Ros of course had to report him
OL,17, missing and play the part of the broken
OL,18, wife - supposedly distraught at his    
OL,19, unexplained absence!                   
OL,21, "Not sure yet, they have my details.

OL,6, I can't see what else they will need me
OL,7, for...until they find him..."          
OL,9, "Find his body? Do you think they      
OL,10, will?"                                 
OL,12, "Well, unless they've completely       
OL,13, disposed of any body, which I doubt,   
OL,14, then it's going to turn up sooner or   
OL,15, later. Although, these men wanted him  
OL,16, gone too, so it may be the last we see 
OL,17, of any part of him. I'll have to have a
OL,18, memorial service without him!"         
OL,20, Ros was so laid back about it all, Sam 
OL,21, was struggling to get used to any of it

OL,6, He had to though, or it meant          
OL,7, unravelling the entire thing and       
OL,8, ruining their lives ahead.             
OL,10, "We're going to have to be careful for 
OL,11, a while. I mean, people knew that your 
OL,12, marriage with James wasn't the         
OL,13, happiest..but even so. Let's build up  
OL,14, to being together properly and it will 
OL,15, be so worth it when we can!" He kissed

OL,10, Sam smiled and lay still for a moment, 
OL,11, but then suddenly sat bolt upright.    
OL,13, "Now what?!" She laughed, mocking him. 
OL,15, "Have you spoken to Cathy yet?" He     
OL,16, dreaded having to face James' sister.

OL,7, them are on a cruise holiday, but      
OL,8, they're obviously heading back on a
