OL,6, Last week, on Rex Road: the residents  
OL,7, were out in force for a fireworks      
OL,8, display - as much fun was had, the     
OL,9, Lucas family enjoyed a more normal life
OL,10, again; the sparks flew between Jack and
OL,11, Jo and, as a rocket launched, she      
OL,12, kissed him.                            
OL,14, EPISODE NINETY TWO                     
OL,16, The end of the week came around, it was
OL,17, grey and drizzling in Alborford, as    
OL,18, James headed back home from work.      
OL,20, "Hello darling, how's your day been?"  
OL,21, He kissed Ros as they met in the hall.

OL,6, "Not bad thanks, people are buying     
OL,7, memberships for Christmas now, so loads
OL,8, of enquiries," she could tell he wasn't
OL,9, really bothering to listen to the      
OL,10, answer, just preparing for what he said
OL,11, next.                                  
OL,13, "I won't have any dinner tonight, I    
OL,14, need to head out for a work meeting -  
OL,15, having a bite to eat too," he smiled   
OL,16, and she knew what the smile meant.     
OL,18, "Not just work though, is it?"         
OL,20, "Well, no. We did say we'd be honest,  
OL,21, didn't we," he kissed her again.

OL,6, She pulled away slightly.              
OL,8, "You were going to live with that?"    
OL,10, "Yes, well maybe I will go out and find
OL,11, some action on the side too?"          
OL,13, James stroked her arm, even managing to
OL,14, make this patronising.                 
OL,16, "You know that's not possible - Sam    
OL,17, doesn't want to be just that, does he?"
OL,18, He laughed and headed to the bathroom, 
OL,19, leaving Ros fuming in the hallway.     
OL,21, "Who is the first one arriving?"

OL,6, Kris asked Phil, looking over his      
OL,7, shoulder at a list of candidates for   
OL,8, new housemate.                         
OL,10, "Jane Templeton - sounds posh!" Phil   
OL,11, grinned.                               
OL,13, "Oh blimey, she'll be stuck up then!"  
OL,15, "Now, now, Kris, don't start judging   
OL,16, already, before we've even met her!"   
OL,18, Right on cue, there was a knock on the 
OL,19, door and Jane was brought into the     
OL,20, lounge. A tall brunette, dressed very  
OL,21, classily.

OL,6, "Lovely to meet you all!" She was very 
OL,7, well spoken, but also someone they     
OL,8, could warm to quickly as the           
OL,9, conversation flowed.                   
OL,11, "What do you do for a living?" Kris    
OL,12, asked.                                 
OL,14, "I work for a Norwich financial        
OL,15, advisers, it's very busy but I enjoy   
OL,16, it. I wanted to live somewhere out of  
OL,17, the city, to separate work and home a  
OL,18, bit more - and I've always loved       
OL,19, visiting Alborford, really nice town

OL,6, "We like it! Your job sounds           
OL,7, impressive, if you don't mind me       
OL,8, asking, why would you want to live with
OL,9, us haha?" Phil asked, blushing         
OL,10, schoolboy like, Kris almost tutting at 
OL,11, him.                                   
OL,13, "Oh, I'm not exactly loaded...and I

OL,15, rented alone recently and not enjoyed  
OL,16, it that much, it's nice to have a house
OL,17, full to come back to, isn't it," they  
OL,18, all look at her and nodded and smiled, 
OL,19, she was making a good impression so    
OL,20, far! Would she be the first and final  
OL,21, choice though? Three more to see!
