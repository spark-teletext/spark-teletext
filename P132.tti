OL,19, fact that Paul had fallen off the wagon
OL,20, again...only Josie knew why, and       
OL,21, couldn't even tell her husband.

OL,6, "I dunno, love, he must be a weak man  
OL,7, for this to keep happening," Don       
OL,8, sighed.                                
OL,10, "Well, we're all weak in our own way   
OL,11, aren't we? And anyway, alcoholism is a 
OL,12, disease, not a sign of weakness!" Don  
OL,13, could recognise an argument brewing, so
OL,14, decided to back down.                  
OL,16, "Are you OK Josie, you've seemed on    
OL,17, edge for a few days?"
