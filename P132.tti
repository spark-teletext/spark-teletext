OL,6, Last week on Rex Road: Sexy mature     
OL,7, student Dan Morgan was the latest being
OL,8, interviewed, who would be chosen? Ros  
OL,9, spotted James out with new lover,      
OL,10, Clare.                                 
OL,12, EPISODE NINETY FIVE                    
OL,14, It was the anniversary of when James   
OL,15, and Ros had first met...and the day    
OL,16, started with a trip into town, and they
OL,17, walked through Alborford Park - the    
OL,18, Christmas lights of the town now up and
OL,19, twinkling, lining the route.           
OL,21, "It looks beautiful, doesn't it,

OL,6, I always love the build up to          
OL,7, Christmas!!" Ros was excited and       
OL,8, gripped James' hand, he was surprised  
OL,9, how affectionate she was today.        
OL,11, "What's wrong, sweetheart?" She asked, 
OL,12, smiling sweetly.                       
OL,14, "Well, I'm surprised how nice you are  
OL,15, being to me today, my love! After our  
OL,16, chat last night?"                      
OL,18, Ros looked up at some of the other     
OL,19, lights, as they turned the corner into 
OL,20, the High Street, the hustle and bustle 
OL,21, of shoppers coming into view.

OL,6, "When we talked about Clare, you mean?"
OL,8, "Er, yeah! Yet today, you're all loved 
OL,9, up with me?" James felt flummoxed,     
OL,10, usually enjoying the control he felt by
OL,11, having more control in the marriage.   
OL,13, "Well, I've slept on it, and let's face
OL,14, it I've never been able to influence   
OL,15, your playing around before have I?     
OL,16, That's who you are, I won't change it  
OL,17, now, so I may as well let you get on   
OL,18, with it! She's welcome to share you,   
OL,19, gives me a chance to watch some telly  
OL,20, and do the books for work later!" He   
OL,21, was staggered, shocked to the core.

OL,6, Where had this change of heart come    
OL,7, from?                                  
OL,9, He didn't like it....or did he? James  
OL,10, had to consider this seemingly new Ros.
OL,12, "Don't look so shocked, James, I can   
OL,13, change even if you cannot! Oh look,    
OL,14, those earrings might be good for Cathy 
OL,15, this Christmas, do you think she would 
OL,16, like them?"                            
OL,18, James looked her up and down and then  
OL,19, noticed a text appearing on his phone  
OL,20, from Clare.

OL,6, "Er yeah, very nice, perhaps we should 
OL,7, get them.."                            
OL,9, Their wander around town carried on for
OL,10, some time, ending with a drink at The  
OL,11, Rose & Crown.                          
OL,13, "Look at them, cute," Ros gestured     
OL,14, towards a kissing Jack and Jo behind   
OL,15, the bar.                               
OL,17, "I remember us like that, in the first

OL,19, holding her hand. She seemed to jump a

OL,6, "Anyway, you'd best meet Clare, eh?"   
OL,7, Ros grinned, acting like it was a      
OL,8, dentist appointment or something.      
OL,10, "Yeah, you're right, I'll get going,   
OL,11, see you later, thanks for today," they

OL,14, Once she knew he was out of sight, Ros 
OL,15, dialled a number on her phone. She     
OL,16, looked around the pub, as if to ensure 
OL,17, nobody was looking or listening.       
OL,19, "Hello, yes, it's me..it worked like a
