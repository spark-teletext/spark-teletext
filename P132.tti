OL,7,Ffor James to be bumped off, he was     
OL,8,Fdumping Clare and deciding to head back

OL,14, Ros was awake early that Monday        
OL,15, morning, lying in bed about 5am,       
OL,16, staring at a sleeping James next to    
OL,17, her.                                   
OL,19, She'd given in to his charms the night 
OL,20, before, going through the motions to   
OL,21, provide the illusion all was well.

OL,6, She had to convince him that she wanted
OL,7, to be married to him for a while longer
OL,8, - the contract was set for two weeks   
OL,9, time, which was going to feel like an  
OL,10, eternity!                              
OL,12, Was she doing the right thing? Of      
OL,13, course not, but for Ros it felt like   
OL,14, the only way out. She hadn't been      
OL,15, thinking straight for some time now,   
OL,16, and she knew that leaving him wasn't   
OL,17, going to be an option. She'd tried it  
OL,18, before and he had a certain power over 
OL,19, her that nobody else could ever        
OL,20, understand.

OL,6, His womanising had gradually worn her  
OL,7, down for years, she thought she could  
OL,8, handle it. She even thought at one     
OL,9, point that it was not a problem, that  
OL,10, they could have an open marriage.      
OL,12, No. That wasn't what she wanted. And   
OL,13, now, she had fallen for Sam once more, 
OL,14, and life was looking different, she had
OL,15, a way out of this.                     
OL,17, She was transfixed, gazing at him for  
OL,18, some time. Once upon a time, the love  
OL,19, of her life. Now, enemy number one. It 
OL,20, would all be over soon, she would be   
OL,21, free at last.

OL,6, Paul and Ali were getting ready for    
OL,7, work later than morning, and he was    
OL,8, very quiet.                            
OL,10, "You alright, love? Did you not sleep  
OL,11, well?"                                 
OL,13, "I'm okay...yeah, not brilliantly, bit 
OL,14, knackered!" He lied, he was thinking   
OL,15, about Nathan's words. Usually Paul     
OL,16, would have wanted to knock his block   
OL,17, off, but the temptation of drink was   
OL,18, always there of course, and it played  
OL,19, on his mind and upset him instead.     
OL,21, At that moment, Nathan appeared.

OL,6, "Morning! Anyone for toast?" He smiled 
OL,7, at them both, his gaze fixing on Paul. 
OL,9, "You okay, Paul? You look more tired   
OL,10, than me, and I had too many beers,     
OL,11, what's your excuse?" He smiled         
OL,12, intently, unnerving Paul even more.    
OL,14, At The Rose & Crown, Jack was up early 
OL,15, to greet workmen, there to begin       
OL,16, repairing and renovating the areas     
OL,17, damaged by the recent fire.            
OL,19, "Come in guys, help yourselves to some 
OL,20, brekkie and drinks over there!" Jo was 
OL,21, filling coffee pots and bacon rolls.

OL,6, "Cheers mate! This looks great!"       
OL,8, Jack felt like the natural host again, 
OL,9, and put an arm around Jo.              
OL,11, "Thanks for sorting this, darling!"    
OL,13, "You're welcome! I love seeing you so
