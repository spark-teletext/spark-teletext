OL,18, Ros was nervous, in a room with four

OL,7, June - he is due to be in London 1st   
OL,8, June if that makes it easier?"         
OL,10, He smiled - "I rather think it does, we

OL,12, Alborford, so it's best - and it keeps 
OL,13, everything away from you!"             
OL,15, "That's perfect, I just want to know

OL,6, "Yes, well, I've been needing to talk  
OL,7, to you. This isn't really what I want  
OL,8, any more. I know what you said, and    
OL,9, that your feelings are deeper

OL,6, They parted ways, and James headed back
OL,7, to Alborford.                          
OL,9, Over at the Lucas household, Paul and  
OL,10, Ali had reluctantly let Nathan stay,   
OL,11, since he raised the alarm about the pub
OL,12, fire - taking pity on him for what he  
OL,13, and Laura experienced that day. Now    
OL,14, though, the cracks were beginning to

OL,6, As she walked away, he turned to Paul -
OL,8, "Maybe I could pop out and get some
