OL,18, "Busy day ahead, Nathan?"

OL,6, "I'm sure," she sneered, which Laura   
OL,7, noticed.                               
OL,9, "And you've got the day off, Laura? Any
OL,10, plans? We can go shopping if you like? 
OL,11, I was thinking of going to Hamborough, 
OL,12, they've got a new boutique?" Laura felt
OL,13, overjoyed, knowing she could spend time
OL,14, with her Mum and feel safe.            
OL,16, "Yes, that would be lovely, Mum!"      
OL,18, Nathan looked at Laura, as if warning  
OL,19, her to keep her mouth shut. She        
OL,20, sheepishly looked down at her toast.

OL,6, Dan wandered into the lounge, wearing

OL,6, Josie stopped Ali and Laura as they    
OL,7, were about to get in the car.          
OL,9, "Off somewhere nice?" Ali instantly    
OL,10, knew she would be angling for an

OL,13, "Hamborough, bit of a girls day out, as

OL,6, Dan ended his run, and was catching his
OL,7, breath and stretching around the corner
OL,8, from Rex Road, when Rach appeared,     
OL,9, carrying some shopping bags.           
OL,11, "Need some help with those?" Dan asked,
OL,12, with a coy smile.                      
OL,14, "No, it's fine, thank you! Blimey, you 
OL,15, look like you've had quite a run...erm,
OL,16, looking good!" She couldn't help admire
OL,17, the muscular frame, and gently tapped  
OL,18, his arm.                               
OL,20, "You're looking good too, beautiful if
