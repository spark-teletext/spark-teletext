OL,6, "That doesn't make him hero number one 
OL,7, though, you don't have to have him

OL,9, even more intensely.

OL,6, Sam and Ros were in Norwich, having    
OL,7, been for breakfast and wandered through
OL,8, Cathedral Close. Both of them had time 
OL,9, off - and it was now only a week before
OL,10, the contract on James was due.         
OL,12, "Ros, are you absolutely sure about    
OL,13, this? I can't sleep thinking about it, 
OL,14, we're not talking about a trivial thing
OL,15, here, it's murder!"                    
OL,17, "Keep your voice down will you! I am   
OL,18, aware of this, you know, but there is  
OL,19, no other way now that I am going to be 
OL,20, rid of him!" He was becoming more      
OL,21, worried about her mental state now.

OL,6, "How can that be...we can run away     
OL,7, together, that's a lot simpler. James  
OL,8, isn't a gangster, it's not like he's   
OL,9, going to track us both down and punish

OL,11, come.

OL,15, dealt with them, he may as well be a   
OL,16, gangster with his connections. And I   
OL,17, believe he would find us, and it's down
