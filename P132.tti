OL,13, Josie was walking down Alborford High  
OL,14, Street, gazing occasionally into a shop
OL,15, window, when she spotted two familiar  
OL,16, faces heading towards her.             
OL,18, "Blimey! Rich and Helen Porter, as I   
OL,19, live and breathe! Is that really you?" 
OL,21, Rich grinned at her, almost grimacing.

OL,6, "Hello, darling, how are you doing? How
OL,7, is Don? And the boys?" They all        
OL,8, embraced, but it was forced and somehow
OL,9, quite painful for them all too.        
OL,11, "Oh, all very well! Max moved in with  
OL,12, his young lady, Fiona! Sam has a good  
OL,13, new job and they're both growing into  
OL,14, fine men for sure! I'm so sorry to hear
OL,15, about James, you must be worried sick!"
OL,16, Josie patted them on the arms.         
OL,18, "Oh we certainly are, it's just so     
OL,19, strange for him to be gone this long!" 
OL,20, Helen added.

OL,6, Yet, as they spoke, Josie thought that 
OL,7, they didn't actually look that worried.
OL,8, In fact, an almost unnatural lack of   
OL,9, paternal or maternal feeling there.    
OL,11, "Well, I'm sure the police are doing   
OL,12, everything they can to find him, he'll 
OL,13, turn up safe and sound soon! You've got
OL,14, Chris and Cathy with you? How are they 
OL,15, doing?"                                
OL,17, Rich looked at Helen to answer, he     
OL,18, seemed like he was itching to escape   
OL,19, from Josie now.

OL,6, ...worried too of course, but Chris and
OL,7, James weren't close, as I'm sure you   
OL,8, know," she added in rather a loaded    
OL,9, way.                                   
OL,11, They weren't close alright, thought    
OL,12, Josie, because Chris was a damn selfish
OL,13, weirdo the last she knew about him! The
OL,14, Porter family were well known in the   
OL,15, town, but not always for the best of   
OL,16, reasons.                               
OL,18, They were all trouble, and James       
OL,19, probably the worst of them. It was no  
OL,20, wonder that he turned out the way he   
OL,21, did. Serial adulterer!

OL,6, Kids with other women, but none with   
OL,7, his wife! Josie and Ali had many a     
OL,8, morning coffee discussion about her    
OL,9, disgusted they were by James Porter in 
OL,10, any given week!                        
OL,12, "Indeed I do know.."                   
OL,14, "Anyway, we had better get going now,  
OL,15, got to make the most of the time with  
OL,16, Ros - and lots of legal stuff to take  
OL,17, care of! Nice to see you, Josie, we'll 
OL,18, see you all around I'm sure!" They all 
OL,19, parted ways, and Josie curled a lip.   
OL,20, I'm sure I will see you, more's the    
OL,21, pity, she thought!

OL,6, Ros was trying her best to entertain   
OL,7, Chris, as Rich and Helen had popped    
OL,8, into town for supplies. Cathy was due  
OL,9, to arrive, which for once Ros was      
OL,10, looking forward to.
