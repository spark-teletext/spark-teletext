OL,6, Last time, on Rex Road: Ros continued  
OL,7, to be wound up by James; Jack and Jo   
OL,8, were enjoying romantic bliss - but it  
OL,9, was getting on Kris's nerves!          
OL,11, EPISODE NINETY NINE                    
OL,13, "That was really nice, darling, am so  
OL,14, glad we did that!" Jack had been to    
OL,15, meet Jo's parents and everything had   
OL,16, gone so much better than he could have 
OL,17, imagined.                              
OL,19, They were pretty easy to get along     
OL,20, with, but even so - Jack's romantic    
OL,21, life had been on hold.

OL,6, He'd been so afraid of any moves,      
OL,7, including meeting a partner's parents -
OL,8, this was a breakthrough.               
OL,10, "They loved you, I can tell they really
OL,11, did - they weren't just being polite!" 
OL,12, Jo almost squealed with excitement.    
OL,14, "Thank you! I, er, think! Are they     
OL,15, often just polite?"                    
OL,17, She laughed - "You know what I         
OL,18, mean...and there haven't been that     
OL,19, many, I promise!"

OL,6, He looked at her, transfixed and       
OL,7, seemingly hypnotised.                  
OL,9, "Couple of hours....why?"              
OL,11, "We have some time to head upstairs    
OL,12, then, don't we!"                       
OL,14, Over at Number Two, Josie and Don were 
OL,15, enjoying some peace and quiet. He'd    
OL,16, finished work early, whilst Sam was    
OL,17, still out and Max and Fiona busy in    
OL,18, their first full week back at work
