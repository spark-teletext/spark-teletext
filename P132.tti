OL,14, Back on Rex Road, the police had       
OL,15, restrained Kris as an ambulance        
OL,16, arrived. Jo was distraught now, and    
OL,17, Rachel tried to comfort her, as the    
OL,18, curtains twitched here and there.      
OL,20, "Don't hurt her! She's my best friend!"

OL,12, "Is that really necessary?" Rachel

OL,14, having temper tantrums before, but     
OL,15, couldn't quite believe that things had

OL,6, Kris was led into the ambulance, her   
OL,7, head was down and she walked in total

OL,6, Jimmy asked, and that was what he was  
OL,7, banking on. For he'd realised what he'd
OL,8, missed by letting her go, and saw some 
OL,9, faint chance of getting it back.       
OL,11, "No, I don't think it'll come to that,"
OL,12, she almost laughed, but Josie knew that
OL,13, it could make or break her family.     
OL,15, At their Holland Road flat, Max, Fiona,
OL,16, Nathan and Lisa were enjoying a
