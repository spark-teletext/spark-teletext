OL,10,Fstaying in Alborford! He made plans    
OL,11,Fwith Kris and Jo to advertise for a new

OL,6, "Lil's opened up the bar tonight, I may
OL,7, even have the whole night off! Treat   
OL,8, myself!" Jack was feeling relaxed,     
OL,9, being able to chill out for a few      
OL,10, hours.                                 
OL,12, "I should think so too, mate, you work 
OL,13, all the hours sent to keep that place  
OL,14, going!" Max spotted Jo arriving, with  
OL,15, Phil and Kris, looking back at an      
OL,16, uncomfortable Jack. His mind was still 
OL,17, on Jo, wanting to talk to her, but not 
OL,18, finding the nerve.                     
OL,20, "Oi, oi, Redfern at nine o'clock," Kris
OL,21, nudged Jo hard in the ribs.

OL,6, "Ow, get off! Yes, I had noticed, thank
OL,7, you!" Jo smiled and tried to catch     
OL,8, Jack's eye, until eventually he looked 
OL,9, up and smiled.                         
OL,11, The Lucases arrived and moved alongside
OL,12, Don and Josie, who'd asked Sam along   
OL,13, but he'd headed into Norwich to visit  
OL,14, friends instead.                       
OL,16, "Hello! You should get one of these    
OL,17, jacket spuds, love, really tasty!" Ali 
OL,18, cried to Josie, above the sound of the 
OL,19, crowd building.

OL,6, The place was mobbed, wasn't it?" Don  
OL,7, nodded and waved.                      
OL,9, "Shall we get a drink from the stalls  
OL,10, over there?" Ali asked.                
OL,12, "Oh yeah, please, grab me a beer will  
OL,13, you? You want one....sorry mate, slip  
OL,14, of the tongue!" Don felt embarrassed,  
OL,15, realising what he was asking Paul.     
OL,17, Paul laughed "Don't worry about it, I'm

OL,6, "How are you doing?" Jack and Jo bumped
OL,7, into each other, just as the fireworks 
OL,8, were starting.                         
OL,10, "Good thanks, this has soon come around

OL,7, I don't like you..and I really enjoyed 
OL,8, that night. But. But, I feel so        
OL,9, guilty," he spluttered over the words,

OL,12, "Cassie would want you to be happy,    
OL,13, Jack, she really would. You know that,
