OL,6,CLast time, on Rex Road:                
OL,8,FFamilies were fractured - Laura and the
OL,9,FLucases were estranged, and as Paul    
OL,10,Freturned from rehab she was nowhere to 
OL,11,Fbe seen.                               
OL,13,FRach continued to sneak around with

OL,21, as he got upset by Laura's absence.

OL,6, "I hope so, although I know I bring it 
OL,7, on myself, if she decided not to..."   
OL,9, Ali seethed inside, knowing that Nathan
OL,10, had Laura more under his control than  
OL,11, ever, and she wished she knew how to   
OL,12, break that.                            
OL,14, Down the road, Rach caught Dan in an   
OL,15, alleyway, and snatched a few snogs     
OL,16, before anyone came along.              
OL,18, "How long can we keep getting away with
OL,19, this?!" Rach breathed, hands           
OL,20, everywhere.

OL,6, Dan kissed her hard -                  
OL,8, "Stop worrying so much, it's meant to  
OL,9, be fun!"

OL,6, "Er, yes...don't you?"                 
OL,8, Dan forgot himself for that moment,    
OL,9, feelings emotions he'd forced down, and
OL,10, shook himself down inside.             
OL,12, "Yes...yeah, obvs...ignore me and kiss 
OL,13, me!"                                   
OL,15, As they continued, a figure loomed     
OL,16, nearby, watching...                    
OL,18, "Sam? Are you up there?" Josie called  
OL,19, out...silence.

OL,6, Josie muttered, as she strolled into   
OL,7, the kitchen.                           
OL,9, Don looked up from his paper -         
OL,11, "At least he's finished with Ros now,  
OL,12, she was stressing him out all the      
OL,13, time!"                                 
OL,15, "True....the Merry Widow, as they still
OL,16, call her down the Rose and Crown       
OL,17, sometimes."                            
OL,19, Don smiled at Josie's turn of phrase.

OL,6, "It's hard to put paid to rumours like 
OL,7, that, people still believe that she had
OL,8, something to do with James' death, in  
OL,9, spite of the police letting her go.."  
OL,11, "Whatever the truth is, I don't want   
OL,12, our son mixing with the likes of       
OL,13, her...am just glad it's over!"         
OL,15, Meanwhile, Sam sat in the cafe, killing
OL,16, time before work, and gazed at pics of 
OL,17, Ros on his phone, wondering if he      
OL,18, should make contact again. They'd

OL,20, something always drew him back...
