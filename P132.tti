OL,8, holiday weekend!                       
OL,10, "I'm really excited for today, can't

OL,14, Jack rolled his eyes slightly.         
OL,16, "Not quite the same myself, but it

OL,6, At the Lucases, Ali and Laura were     
OL,7, settling down in front of the telly,   
OL,8, watching some of the coverage that had 
OL,9, already begun.                         
OL,11, "I'm excited for this," Ali cooed,     
OL,12, sipping her coffee. She looked over at 
OL,13, Laura, as Paul and Rhys worked on      
OL,14, something in the garden. Nathan,       
OL,15, meanwhile, was visiting his parents.   
OL,17, "You're quiet...in fact, you've not    
OL,18, said much since our chat!"             
OL,20, "Not sure there's much to say, Mum, you
OL,21, don't like Nathan and you want rid!"

OL,6, "I know that he is treating you badly, 
OL,7, you just won't admit to it..." She was 
OL,8, struggling to control her temper, ready
OL,9, to boil over.                          
OL,11, "We're going to have to leave, that's  
OL,12, all. It's about time we got our own    
OL,13, place anyway.."                        
OL,15, "I'll keep quiet then. Let's just try  
OL,16, and not fall out today, darling," Ali  
OL,17, looked at her, smiling. Yet,           
OL,18, underneath, she was furious. She wanted
OL,19, Nathan gone, but also punished, and    
OL,20, kept away from her daughter!
