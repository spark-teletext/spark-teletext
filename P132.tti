OL,14, Dan was on his way back from College,  
OL,15, when he passed the Magnolia Beauty     
OL,16, Salon, as Rachel was bringing in the   
OL,17, sign before closing for the day.       
OL,19, "Oh, hello again Dan, how are you?" She
OL,20, felt immediately flushed, knowing she  
OL,21, was attracted to him.

OL,8, "Call me Rach, please!"                
OL,10, He went red also, a mixture of         
OL,11, embarrassment, and a mutual attraction 
OL,12, forming.                               
OL,14, "Sure, thanks, Rach! How are you?"     
OL,16, She played with her hair as they

OL,6, He felt as though he wanted to go ahead
OL,7, alone, but thought that'd be rude, so  
OL,8, agreed.                                
OL,10, "You're quiet, darling? What's up?"    
OL,11, Paul asked Laura, kissing her on the   
OL,12, head, as he wandered around the        
OL,13, kitchen, opening cupboards.            
OL,15, She tried to think quickly -           
OL,17, "Difficult day at work, the boss has   
OL,18, set us trainees some hefty targets!"   
OL,20, He laughed "That's what you get paid

OL,6, Are you and lover boy likely to move   
OL,7, out and get your own love nest? He's   
OL,8, earning well now, isn't he?"           
OL,10, "Yes, the job's going well - salesman

OL,6, She didn't feel safe with Nathan, and  
OL,7, if anyone would protect her, it would  
OL,8, be them.                               
OL,10, "True, I just want to be looked after

OL,6, Dan and Rachel arrived back in Rex     
OL,7, Road, after she nervously babbled all  
OL,8, the way back, trying to impress him and
OL,9, feeling like a schoolgirl.             
OL,11, "Right, this is me, I'll see you       
OL,12, around!" Dan said casually, but he shot
OL,13, her a smile as he went into the house, 
OL,14, that made her feel wobbly. Rich opened 
OL,15, the door -                             
OL,16, "Who was that? I thought I heard
