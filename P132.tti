OL,6, Last week on Rex Road: James made it   
OL,7, clear to Ros that he was still going to
OL,8, consider their marriage an open one; Jo
OL,9, was dumped by Mike, and quickly sought 
OL,10, comfort in Jack's arms!                
OL,12, EPISODE EIGHTY EIGHT                   
OL,14, Jo awoke in Jack's room in The Rose &  
OL,15, Crown, cuddling him as he began to wake
OL,16, up too.                                
OL,18, "Mmmm?" He groaned, opening his eyes   
OL,19, and beginning to realise he was not    
OL,20, alone.

OL,6, "Good morning, how are you doing?" Jo  
OL,7, cooed, stroking his arm gently.        
OL,9, Jack's eyes became wide, immediately   
OL,10, quite horrified by their spending the  
OL,11, night together. Since Cassie died, he  
OL,12, hadn't been able to consider anybody   
OL,13, else - and this was rocking his        
OL,14, carefully protected foundations.       
OL,16, "Yes, yeah, I'm fine thanks!" He almost
OL,17, leapt out of bed, pulling on his       
OL,18, dressing gown and not looking her in   
OL,19, the eye.                               
OL,21, "Jack? Seriously, what's wrong?

OL,6, Are you regretting last night?"        
OL,8, James and Ros were also in bed, after  
OL,9, what was a passionate night for them   
OL,10, too.                                   
OL,12, "It's not been like that since our     
OL,13, early days, has it?" James asked,      
OL,14, kissing her again.                     
OL,16, "That's true actually," Ros replied,   
OL,17, looking him up and down. Her feelings  
OL,18, were all over the place, going from    
OL,19, despising him...to falling in love all 
OL,20, over again in the space of minutes     
OL,21, sometimes.

OL,6, After all their ups and downs - his    
OL,7, numerous affairs, Sam, finding out he  
OL,8, had children with other women - she was
OL,9, still under his spell.                 
OL,11, Part of her wanted to be free of him,  
OL,12, but he knew exactly which buttons to   
OL,13, push, to remind her about the things   
OL,14, she did like again.                    
OL,16, "Shall we go out somewhere today? Maybe
OL,17, head to the coast, Sheringham maybe? I 
OL,18, want to romance you, my love!" James   
OL,19, smiled.                                
OL,21, "Romance is a bag of chips for sure!"

OL,6, Ros laughed. He looked a little        
OL,7, crestfallen.                           
OL,9, "Relax, I'm joking! Wow, it's not like 
OL,10, you to be sensitive!"                  
OL,12, "I know, but things do feel a bit      
OL,13, different now...and I know you've      
OL,14, tolerated my ways in the past, it's    
OL,15, part of who we are though isn't it,    
OL,16, keeps the flame burning!" He was       
OL,17, ruining it now. She had to decide once 
OL,18, and for all, could she put up with this
OL,19, forever more, or did she want a husband
OL,20, who really was dedicated to her?

OL,6, Later that day, Sam was strolling down 
OL,7, Rex Road, when James and Ros were      
OL,8, preparing to leave for the coast.      
OL,10, "Alright Sam mate, how are you? We're  
OL,11, just off to the coast, nice day for    
OL,12, it!" James cheerily cried.             
OL,14, "It sure is, yeah am fine thanks," he  
OL,15, looked at Ros, who was avoiding his    
OL,16, gaze. Still hankering after her, it all
OL,17, felt very awkward.                     
OL,19, "Nobody on the scene for you right     
OL,20, now?" James asked.

OL,6, "Get in the car, James!" Ros nipped    
OL,7, that in the bud fast.                  
OL,9, That evening, the pub was in full      
OL,10, swing, and Jo was also on shift -      
OL,11, having awkwardly left in the morning   
OL,12, already.                               
OL,14, "Pint please mate," Max asked Jack,    
OL,15, instantly aware that he wasn't in a    
OL,16, good mood.                             
OL,18, "Are you okay? Jo seems a bit moody too
OL,19, - you workers had a row?" He laughed.
