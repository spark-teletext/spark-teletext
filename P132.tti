OL,6, Everyone got on so well these days.    
OL,8, Paul watched them, so happy that he was
OL,9, well again and able to enjoy this with 
OL,10, his family. There had been times in his
OL,11, life when he never thought he'd be     
OL,12, sober and happy at the same time.      
OL,13, Hopefully, all of that was way behind  
OL,14, him now.                               
OL,16, "Oh, Paul, I do love days like this    
OL,17, together, think I'd better get in that 
OL,18, kitchen, or the dinner will never be

OL,6, Doris was chatting to Fiona as they    
OL,7, washed up together.                    
OL,9, "Did you ever have family days like    
OL,10, this with your parents?" Doris asked.  
OL,12, Fiona immediately felt uncomfortable   
OL,13, with this subject, but went along with 
OL,14, it so she wouldn't offend Doris.       
OL,16, "We'd often spend weekends together,"  
OL,17, Fiona's eyes started to well up at the 
OL,18, thought of it. They weren't all bad    
OL,19, memories.

OL,6, The bad feeling was more or less       
OL,7, forgotten in the months since Cathy    
OL,8, fled Rex Road, after getting up to no  
OL,9, good with Rhys Lucas. Cathy had met up 
OL,10, with Ros elsewhere and they'd made up, 
OL,11, Ros much more reluctantly. She couldn't
OL,12, quite make the break, having a close
