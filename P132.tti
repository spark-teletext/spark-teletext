OL,6, Max ended it with her last night, and  
OL,7, she packed her bags straight away..."  
OL,9, "Well, I don't blame her. She's not    
OL,10, even done anything wrong has she?!"    
OL,12, "No, and she's my cousin, but he can't 
OL,13, help the way he feels can he!" Jack    
OL,14, also knew what a nightmare she can be  
OL,15, to live with.                          
OL,17, "I know...I do feel sorry for her

OL,6, Jack shot her a look -                 
OL,7, "Well, I think we know each other      
OL,8, better than they did...you would be    
OL,9, able to tell!"                         
OL,11, At the Lucases, Ali sat Rhys down, to  
OL,12, discuss his father.                    
OL,14, "He's staying in the rehab centre now, 
OL,15, and they can give him the best kind of

OL,6, "Is Dad going to die?"                 
OL,8, She felt her blood run cold. Last time 
OL,9, he was like this, she really did wonder
OL,10, if he would die.                       
OL,12, "Of course not, he'll be fine. But you 
OL,13, and I can't help him, he needs doctors 
OL,14, to do that. Try not to worry, he'll be 
OL,15, home soon...' She only hoped she could 
OL,16, keep her promise.

OL,6, Later that day, Rach snuck out to      
OL,7, Number Six, to see Dan.                
OL,9, "I'm on my lunch break, so I can't be  
OL,10, too long, I just had to see you!" Rach 
OL,11, was flushed and excited. It had been a 
OL,12, couple of weeks since they were able to
OL,13, be alone. She was playing with fire,   
OL,14, they'd agreed they would not meet in   
OL,15, either house.                          
OL,17, "We said we wouldn't meet here...but   
OL,18, now you are!" Dan kissed her.          
OL,20, "I know, I just couldn't help myself!"

OL,6, As they took each others clothes off,  
OL,7, she hesitated -                        
OL,9, "What about the others, where are they?
OL,10, When are they due back?"               
OL,12, Dan thought for a moment and then      
OL,13, smiled -                               
OL,15, "Phil is away for work overnight, and  
OL,16, Kris is in her office today, over in   
OL,17, Hamborough. Don't worry, it's fine!"
