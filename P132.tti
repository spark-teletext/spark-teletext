OL,6, Number Six was quiet, as everyone had  
OL,7, headed to their respective families -  
OL,8, apart from Jo, who was still seeing    
OL,9, Jack...and they had decided to spend   
OL,10, part of Christmas together at the pub. 
OL,12, Over at Number Ten, James and Ros      
OL,13, exchanged presents and kisses in bed.  
OL,15, "Ah, thanks babe, I love this watch!"  
OL,17, "I know, I did take notice of the      
OL,18, hints, you see," Ros chuckled, sipping

OL,7, nicer for how things are between us.   
OL,8, Speaking of which, did you say you're  
OL,9, popping over to your folks later?"     
OL,11, Ros rolled her eyes, without him

OL,6, Christmas lunch time in the Reynolds   
OL,7, was lively, as Fiona had already had   
OL,8, too much to drink and Sam and Max were 
OL,9, having a gamer play off, regressing    
OL,10, back to being little boys again.       
OL,12, "Come on boys, get to the table now!"  
OL,13, Josie cried, smiling to herself,       
OL,14, nothing made her happier than seeing   
OL,15, her boys together. It took her back to 
OL,16, so many Christmas Days gone by, up so  
OL,17, early to open their presents, full of  
OL,18, excitement and festive joy. This was   
OL,19, always a favourite day for her.        
OL,21, "Be there in a sec, Mum," Sam laughed.
