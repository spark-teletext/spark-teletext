OL,17, Rex Road.                              
OL,19, "Hi, I'm Ben Walker, nice to meet you!"
OL,20, A guy in his twenties stepped in,      
OL,21, seemingly supremely confident.

OL,6, "Take...er, a seat!" Kris said,        
OL,7, realising he had already taken his     
OL,8, seat!                                  
OL,10, "Thanks, didn't realise I'd be living  
OL,11, with two babes!" He grinned, eyeing up 
OL,12, Kris and Jo in quite a creepy way.     
OL,14, "And me mate...and me. It's not in the 
OL,15, bag yet, we have some questions," he   
OL,16, was getting Phil's hackles up a great  
OL,17, deal right now.                        
OL,19, "Shoot," Ben wasn't phased, leaning

OL,6, "So, you're a student at Alborford     
OL,7, College right now?" Jo asked, trying   
OL,8, her hardest to reserve judgment.       
OL,10, "Yeah, studying sports science," and   
OL,11, seeming like a total meat head right   
OL,12, now, thought Kris.                     
OL,14, "Tell us a bit about yourself and why  
OL,15, you'd like to live here?" Kris asked.  
OL,17, "I fell out with my campus housemates, 
OL,18, stupid morons don't understand my      
OL,19, humour! Am sure you guys will though! A
OL,20, few pranks aren't a bit deal, are they?
OL,21, So, I thought I would look around.

OL,6, Something outside of that environment  
OL,7, and away from them may be best!"       
OL,9, I bet they're relieved, thought Kris,  
OL,10, instantly put off by his talk of pranks
OL,11, and cocky demeanour. This was going to 
OL,12, be back to the drawing board!          
OL,14, At the Holland Road flat, Nathan and   
OL,15, Lisa had been rowing all morning.      
OL,16, Things were not going well and it was  
OL,17, crunch time now.                       
OL,19, "I think it's time for a break, Nathan,
OL,20, not sure I am happy now," Lisa wiped   
OL,21, tears from her eyes.

OL,9, "Okay, I will! You're dumped! It's

OL,14, exactly what he would be doing and was 
OL,15, his first thought.                     
OL,17, "I'm leaving today, am going back to my
