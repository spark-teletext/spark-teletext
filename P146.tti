OL,6, Thanks to teletext hobbyists, you can  
OL,7, bring back teletext using nothing more 
OL,8, than a Raspberry Pi and video leads.   
OL,10, The VBIT2 software downloads a teletext
OL,11, service such as SPARK as a set of page 
OL,12, files, and sends them to your TV as a  
OL,13, genuine teletext signal via the Pi's   
OL,14, composite video output.
