OL,6, The human brain is a strange entity.   
OL,7, When you need to get on with something 
OL,8, and that something demands a great deal
OL,9, of thought and concentration, the brain
OL,10, decides to pop on a playlist of classic
OL,11, theme tunes, nursery rhymes, naff pop  
OL,12, songs from days of yore and that tune  
OL,13, that you attempted to write about three
OL,14, years ago and never finished.          
OL,16, My earworm, however, has been quite    
OL,17, enduring and has not relented for forty
OL,18, years.                                 
OL,20, That's right, FORTY years! Imagine     
OL,21, that...

OL,6, If a piece of music starts up and it   
OL,7, has a certain note or phrasing in it,  
OL,8, it sets off this infernal collection of
OL,9, ancient notes in my head and it is     
OL,10, unstoppable, banal and a lifelong      
OL,11, bedevilling "friend." I knew that it   
OL,12, was a theme tune to a programme from   
OL,13, the mid-70s but my search always was   
OL,14, fruitless.                             
OL,16, I mean, before the internet came along,
OL,17, how would one discover the provenance  
OL,18, of a such a thing? Sure, I could       
OL,19, whistle it but after so many years, am 
OL,20, I getting it right? Who wants to hear a
OL,21, man aimlessly tootling an unknown piece
OL,22, of music? Not me!

OL,6, So, the years rolled on and the music  
OL,7, played and played and...well, you know,
OL,8, it played. It drove me nuts. I started 
OL,9, looking for it online. I had no idea   
OL,10, where to begin and I settled upon a    
OL,11, notion that the programme was called   
OL,12, "Out of Bounds."                       
OL,14, My enquiries took me towards a miasma  
OL,15, of geeks and anoraks. They meant well  
OL,16, but they were very little help as they 
OL,17, kept telling me that the piece of music
OL,18, that I wanted was by Kraftwerk. I knew 
OL,19, full well that it was nothing to do    
OL,20, with Florian and the boys... On I      
OL,21, trundled, insisting that it wasn't     
OL,22, Kraftwerk but something else.

OL,6, Several years and a few questions asked
OL,7, of the BBC and I was still stumped.    
OL,8, Kraftwerk, it would seem, did allow    
OL,9, their music to be used for "Out of     
OL,10, Bounds." I was entirely in the wrong   
OL,11, and I admit that I flounced away in a  
OL,12, huff.                                  
OL,14, I was no closer to my goal.            
OL,16, July 4th, 2018 was a day like no other 
OL,17, for me. I'd walked a lot that day and I
OL,18, was suitably tired out. As per usual,  
OL,19, that tune popped into my head a couple 
OL,20, of times and whereas I can sometimes   
OL,21, just ignore it, it was louder than ever
OL,22, and seven times more irritating than in
OL,23, previous weeks.

OL,6, I really needed to start digging again.
OL,7, It was time to burst open a few        
OL,8, otherwise dormant brain cells and track
OL,9, this thing down, once and for all time.
OL,11, I had a sort of notion that the        
OL,12, programme's end titles has a silhouette
OL,13, of Blackpool Tower over which the      
OL,14, credits rolled. That was dredged out of
OL,15, the darkest recesses of my mind and I'm
OL,16, proud of the mental leap that happened 
OL,17, right there. It gave me a brain-wave   
OL,18, and I called into play the one weapon  
OL,19, that a TV geek can (mostly) rely upon. 
OL,21, The BBC Genome site!

OL,6, The BBC Genome has listings for almost 
OL,7, every show that has been broadcast on  
OL,8, the BBC since 1923. This had to work...
OL,9, I needed keywords. "Hmmmmm...children, 
OL,10, Blackpool, 1975." Firstly, I was       
OL,11, offered nonsense such as "Ken Dodd's   
OL,12, Summer Circus!" and "Antiques Roadshow"
OL,13, but then I saw it....                  
OL,15, A dim and half remembered programme    
OL,16, made by German TV in conjunction with  
OL,17, the Beeb. Certain episodes were made in
OL,18, London and Blackpool. Surely not? Could
OL,19, it be what I have been after for so    
OL,20, very long? "Kim & Co" was the title and
OL,21, I popped that into Google along with   
OL,22, the year and BBC for good luck.

OL,6, It offered me a static video with the  
OL,7, title of the show and.......the theme  
OL,8, tune.                                  
OL,10, I have to admit that I was cynical,    
OL,11, albeit strangely nervous. I clicked on 
OL,12, the link and waited for it to buffer.  
OL,13, It was at that moment that I felt as if
OL,14, I had been visited by a ghost. Forty   
OL,15, years of thinking about a certain piece
OL,16, of music. Forty years of not having a  
OL,17, clue as to the title, the programme to 
OL,18, which it was attached and being        
OL,19, uncertain whether I had remembered the 
OL,20, tune correctly. Suddenly, the music    
OL,21, that had long only existed in my mind  
OL,22, was actually coming out of my phone.

OL,6, This may not seem like a big deal to   
OL,7, you, the reader, but this was a moment 
OL,8, in which I was thunderstruck! I think  
OL,9, that all of the blood drained from my  
OL,10, face. I was hearing it and yes, for the
OL,11, main part, I had remembered it         
OL,12, accurately.                            
OL,14, This was like an exorcism and I played 
OL,15, it again and again... Damning that tune
OL,16, to hell and casting it from my mind. I 
OL,17, listened to it again earlier today.    
OL,19, It has already diminished in power and 
OL,20, I reckon that I can excise it from my  
OL,21, daily life soon.
