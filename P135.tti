OL,6, 15 minutes of fame is so much easier   
OL,7, to come by these days, isn't it? When  
OL,8, I were a lad, if you wanted to be on   
OL,9, telly you had to be capable of stuff.  
OL,11, Gladiators, for example. Fortitude,    
OL,12, fitness, determination. Speaking of    
OL,13, determination, Record Breakers. Maybe  
OL,14, the Krypton Factor, The Crystal Maze,  
OL,15, or Bullseye. Robot Wars, Full Metal    
OL,16, Challenge, Scrapheap Challenge, The    
OL,17, Generation Game. The list goes on.     
OL,19, Some admittedly more focussed on       
OL,20, ability than others. But still.

OL,6, Nowadays apparently you can get on TV  
OL,7, for fancying a shag but not being      
OL,8, allowed to have one, or fancying a shag
OL,9, and having one anyway. For the less    
OL,10, adventurous, just pretend you want one 
OL,11, so the producers pick you, or hint that
OL,12, you might be sort-of interested if it  
OL,13, gets viewers.                          
OL,15, It's all a bit base, isn't it? In the  
OL,16,G90s when you wanted to get on TV for   
OL,17,Gfiddling with balls and getting things 
OL,18,Gin holes, you went on Big Break.       
OL,20, Even Blind Date was classier.

OL,6, You didn't even have to be good, you   
OL,7, just had to have a go at trying things 
OL,8, you might not be good at yet, like good
OL,9, old Can't Cook, Won't Cook. Far more   
OL,10, civil than having people round for tea 
OL,11, and then an hour of tape slagging off  
OL,12, your soggy souffle. Didn't need long   
OL,13, tense musical pauses to reveal who's   
OL,14, about to break down in tears either.   
OL,16, So I reckon we should go back to doing 
OL,17, things the 80s way. It was silly but it
OL,18, was all in good taste. And if you don't
OL,19, agree, I've got a gurt big cotton bud  
OL,20, that says otherwise.
