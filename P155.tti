OL,6, Dateline: 21st December 1981 and my    
OL,7, then 7 year old self settled down in   
OL,8, front of the TV to enjoy the final     
OL,9, episode of series 4 of Blake's 7. This 
OL,10, was an episode I was awaiting with keen
OL,11, anticipation as the titular character  
OL,12, was due to return to the show.         
OL,14, Now truth be told I didn't actually    
OL,15, remember Blake that well what with     
OL,16, being only 4 when Gareth Thomas made   
OL,17, his final regular appearance.          
OL,18, Intriguingly it was also being promoted
OL,19, as a shocker of an episode. Still that 
OL,20, didn't faze me as images of unwrapping 
OL,21, presents and gorging on chocolates in  
OL,22, just a few days danced through my head.

OL,6, The episode began with them blowing up 
OL,7, their base, a bit extreme I thought.   
OL,8, Actually I was a kid so I probably     
OL,9, believed somebody had gone out and left
OL,10, the gas oven on, this coming a few     
OL,11, short weeks after my friend's sister   
OL,12, destroyed their kitchen whilst         
OL,13, attempting to fry chips!               
OL,15, Then things started going downhill fast
OL,16, as Scorpio came under attack with      
OL,17, Tarrant volunteering to try to take the
OL,18, damaged ship down safely and being     
OL,19, about as successful as my skills in    
OL,20, pulling the girls in my later single   
OL,21, years!

OL,6, Sadly all the drama of this moment was 
OL,7, lost as for some reason it looked like 
OL,8, the crew had installed a fun slide in  
OL,9, the middle of Scorpio's cockpit which  
OL,10, Tarrant gleefully took a turn on!      
OL,11, Honestly apart from the crushing final 
OL,12, five minutes the only thing my friends 
OL,13, talked about was how fun that looked.  
OL,15, Of course soon after Blake made his    
OL,16, proper return to the show his scar not 
OL,17, bothering me one bit as living on an   
OL,18, East Hull council estate I'd seen      
OL,19, worse! Everybody came together and this
OL,20, was the moment part of my youthful     
OL,21, innocence died.

OL,6, Avon shot Blake, no not the usual sort 
OL,7, of shot in Blake's 7, this time there  
OL,8, was gore, lots of gore and then just   
OL,9, for good measure Avon shot him again...
OL,10, and again. Blake slumped to his knees  
OL,11, (and off screen I'm sure so did his    
OL,12, intentines!) and unquestionably died.  
OL,14, Then a woman revealed herself to be a  
OL,15, baddie and held our heroes at gunpoint.
OL,16, Dayna had a complete brain fart moment 
OL,17, and decided she could bend down, pick  
OL,18, up a gun, aim and shoot at their captor
OL,19, before she could be shot herself.      
OL,20, Needless to say that didn't work out so
OL,21, well and Dayna dropped to the floor at 
OL,22, the same time as many viewers jaws did.

OL,6, I then shuffled uncomfortably as Vila  
OL,7, advanced upon Arlen. No, no, no I was  
OL,8, screaming inside as outside my face    
OL,9, managed the expression a rabbit would  
OL,10, have playing a game of chicken with a  
OL,11, car by standing in the middle of       
OL,12, headlights only at the last second to  
OL,13, realise the advancing vehicle was a    
OL,14, Robin Reliant!                         
OL,16, Vila somewhat surprisingly not only    
OL,17, disarmed Arlen and knocked her out but 
OL,18, also delivered a James Bond worthy quip
OL,19, whilst doing so.

OL,6, This was then the moment the BB bloody 
OL,7, C decided to ruin my Christmas as Vila 
OL,8, forgot it was Panto season and         
OL,9, neglected to "look behind him" and was 
OL,10, promptly shot in the back and "killed" 
OL,11, by a Federation Trooper doing his best 
OL,12, Pantomime Villain impression.          
OL,14, Now it WAS my turn for my jaw to hit   
OL,15, the floor. This was to this day the    
OL,16, most shocking thing I'd seen on        
OL,17, television and I'm speaking as one of  
OL,18, those viewers who saw more of Keith    
OL,19, Chegwin than they ever planned to on   
OL,20, Channel 4's Naked Jungle!

OL,6, As the rest of the cast literally bit  
OL,7, the bullet I sank back into my part of 
OL,8, the sofa, my favourite spot in the home
OL,9, where this young telly addict drank in 
OL,10, all the kids TV and selected grown-up  
OL,11, stuff he could and fought back a tear. 
OL,13, My TV heroes didn't die? They never    
OL,14, died, I'm sure I never saw an episode  
OL,15, of Jamie and the Magic Torch where     
OL,16, Jamie flashed his light in the corner  
OL,17, of the room to discover his loyal dog  
OL,18, Wordsworth laying dead on his back with
OL,19, all four legs stuck in the air.

OL,6, Had I missed an episode of Rentaghost  
OL,7, where loveable Jester Timothy Claypole 
OL,8, went pyscho and bludgeoned the Meaker  
OL,9, family as they slept and was I busy    
OL,10, when the episode of Rainbow aired which
OL,11, revealed that Zippy was really the     
OL,12, inside of a Dalek (hey they were both  
OL,13, Roy Skelton!) who got his armour back  
OL,14, and promptly exterminated Rod, Jane and
OL,15, Freddy for singing another one of their
OL,16, awful songs?                           
OL,18, No, none of that happened and I'd have 
OL,19, probably thoroughly enjoyed and        
OL,20, remembered that last one!

OL,6, Avon was now stood astride the corpse  
OL,7, of Blake like the dominant member of   
OL,8, the pack he truly was, surrounded by   
OL,9, Troopers Avon lifted his gun and on    
OL,10, came the credits accompanied by lots of
OL,11, gunfire. Then the theme tune slowly    
OL,12, came in.                               
OL,14, There was no friendly continuity       
OL,15, announcer to reassuringly announce that
OL,16, the series would return in 1982 and    
OL,17, BBC1 then plodded on with the rest of  
OL,18, its programming leaving millions of    
OL,19, Blake's 7 fans to struggle to come to  
OL,20, terms with what had just gone down.

OL,7, series finale still stands up as the   
OL,8, very best with only Blackadder Goes
