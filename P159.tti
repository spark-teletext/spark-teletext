OL,7, controversial so-called media terrorist
OL,8, and all-round clever bloke Chris

OL,6, It can be argued that Blue Jam is      
OL,7, better at creating a late-night        
OL,8, atmosphere on account of being a radio

OL,12, to the experience.                     
OL,14, Jam is not perfect. It is an acquired  
OL,15, taste, and one of those style over     
OL,16, substance shows where the execution    
OL,17, (i.e. acting, soundtrack, aesthetics)

OL,6, As a simple comedy, it perhaps doesn't 
OL,7, offer the required goods, but as I said
OL,8, earlier, Jam is more than just a       
OL,9, comedy, it's a mood or frame of mind.  
OL,11, There are some sketches from episode   
OL,12, one, such as the man who marries       
OL,13, himself, the attempted suicide, and the
OL,14, doctor who tells a patient to go away, 
OL,15, that are funny the first couple of     
OL,16, times but become gradually more        
OL,17, poignant over time as our initial

OL,7, at a much faster pace. It also predates
OL,8, Jam by several years, having first been
OL,9, broadcast in late 1993, and all the
