OL,6, This week's telly: Classic Coronation  
OL,7, Street - ITV3; Classic EastEnders -    
OL,8, Drama; And Just Like That - Sky        
OL,9, Showcase                               
OL,11, I was away for a few days this week, so
OL,12, viewing options have altered a little -
OL,13, and it's time to revisit those         
OL,14, nostalgic options that are available   
OL,15, for soap fans once more.               
OL,17, Classic Coronation Street is something 
OL,18, I always try to keep up with, and what 
OL,19, better show to binge when you return   
OL,20, from a holiday frankly!

OL,6, The period ITV3 are screening right now
OL,7, is the year 2000 - with new actors and 
OL,8, characters filtering through e.g. Tina 
OL,9, O'Brien as Sarah-Lou (still with the   
OL,10, show today) and old faves like Rita and
OL,11, Jack and Vera.                         
OL,13, Recent episodes have treated us to     
OL,14, Kevin marrying the ditsy and wet       
OL,15, dishcloth Alison - after sleeping with 
OL,16, ex Sally the night before and dooming  
OL,17, the marriage before it's even begun!   
OL,19, A much more exciting storyline is the  
OL,20, Mike - Linda - Mark triangle. Linda was
OL,21, a great figure in the street -

OL,6, common as muck, but clever and out for 
OL,7, what she can get. It's all going to end
OL,8, in tears, but a rollercoaster is       
OL,9, coming!                                
OL,11, And Dev has arrived, comical shouty    
OL,12, Dev! His opening story has been fun - a
OL,13, crazy ex girlfriend convincing the     
OL,14, street residents with lies about him - 
OL,15, very over the top and still with a tone
OL,16, that we just don't get in the street   
OL,17, now.                                   
OL,19, The same is true of Classic EastEnders!
OL,20, It's still a miserable show and always 
OL,21, was, without the same streak of humour.

OL,6, The difference is the standard of      
OL,7, storyline and the actors and strong    
OL,8, characters involved.                   
OL,10, We're currently seeing Bianca becoming 
OL,11, involved with her Mum's boyfriend, Dan.
OL,12, This one becomes explosive, I'd almost 
OL,13, forgotten what a well executed         
OL,14, storyline it becomes!                  
OL,16, Also, this week's episodes treated us  
OL,17, to the spectacle of Dot getting high on
OL,18, cannabis cakes and being arrested -    
OL,19, high camp comedy from June Brown that  
OL,20, was simply hilarious - in fact, that   
OL,21, was the best bit of humour in the show.

OL,6, Anything involving Dot is alright with 
OL,7, me, she is missed!                     
OL,9, Finally this week, I admit it - and I  
OL,10, never thought I would! I am really     
OL,11, enjoying And Just Like That! The follow
OL,12, up to Sex and the City (which I never  
OL,13, watched, only a few bits here and      
OL,14, there!) has unexpectedly captured my   
OL,15, attention and held it.                 
OL,17, The characters do grab me, with their  
OL,18, quirks and flaws and making mistakes in
OL,19, their fifties, whilst living a high    
OL,20, life in New York City (jealous).

OL,6, It's fantasy and believable, all at the
OL,7, same time! You can genuinely imagine   
OL,8, women in NYC living these scenarios.   
OL,9, And the struggles of advancing age and 
OL,10, challenges with children and all       
OL,11, relationships are deftly handled.      
OL,13, Carrie's widowhood so far has been     
OL,14, sensitively written and pretty moving  
OL,15, in many scenes, with some great acting 
OL,16, accompanying unexpected moments of     
OL,17, grief.                                 
OL,19, I like to be surprised by telly and    
OL,20, that has definitely happened with this 
OL,21, show - never expected to enjoy this!
