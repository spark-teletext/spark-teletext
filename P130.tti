OL,6, This week's telly:                     
OL,8, Coronation Street (ITV); Liza: A Truly 
OL,9, Terrific Absolutely True Story (BBC2); 
OL,11, It's been a while, dear reader, and a  
OL,12, lot can change...and a lot can stay the
OL,13, same too...                            
OL,14, One place that has been changing, and  
OL,15, not for the better, is Weatherfield.   
OL,16, What on Earth are ITV doing to         
OL,17, Coronation Street?! They must be on a  
OL,18, mission to destroy it, and in its sixty
OL,19, fifth year on screen too! The soap that
OL,20, I have loved all my life is almost     
OL,21, unrecognisable from a few years ago.

OL,6, Every episode now is like The Bill on  
OL,7, steroids - ramped up police and        
OL,8, emergency services action, with a merry
OL,9, go round of characters in jeopardy.    
OL,11, Rather than Hilda and Stan enjoying    
OL,12, banter in the Rovers, it's a cycle of  
OL,13, misery and death for all concerned.    
OL,14, Why, oh why, ya beggars?!              
OL,16, Was it to compete with EastEnders?     
OL,17, Leave the misery to them, for goodness 
OL,18, sakes. The beauty of Corrie was always 
OL,19, the writing, the characterisation...and
OL,20, the normal way about things.

OL,6, You'd have folk discussing the trivia  
OL,7, of life, and having a laugh, there was 
OL,8, so much humour (and no, Mary is not the
OL,9, same thing). This meant, that when the 
OL,10, dramatic events took place, it was so  
OL,11, much more impactful!                   
OL,13, It's all gone - even Debbie Webster, a 
OL,14, wonderful character in the old mould,  
OL,15, is subjected now to an issue based     
OL,16, storyline on dementia, and will meet   
OL,17, her doom.                              
OL,19, It's not too late, ITV, you can save   
OL,20, the show if you want to, before it's   
OL,21, too late!

OL,6, Liza with a Z! And I bet you know      
OL,7, instantly who I am talking about, when 
OL,8, I say that line?!                      
OL,10, BBC2 gave us such a treat, with the new
OL,11, documentary film - Liza: A Truly       
OL,12, Terrific Absolutely True Story! I've   
OL,13, always been a massive fan - she's      
OL,14, talented, vulnerable, an absolute      
OL,15, survivor - and totally hilarious every 
OL,16, time she opens her mouth.              
OL,18, Just like her life, the doc was a      
OL,19, rollercoaster ride. The opening is a   
OL,20, moment that, in some ways, freed her.  
OL,21, The death of her legendary mother, Judy

OL,6, Garland, was the beginning of Liza     
OL,7, becoming a megastar herself.           
OL,9, Divided into chapters, her story       
OL,10, touched on every key highlight -       
OL,11, Cabaret, which was the catalyst for her
OL,12, star ascending so high; the multiple   
OL,13, marriages; the rehab; the friendships! 
OL,15, Those who spoke about her did so with  
OL,16, real love (Mia Farrow, where have you  
OL,17, been, a nice surprise!), and a picture 
OL,18, was painted of the woman I always      
OL,19, thought she was - a lovably flawed and 
OL,20, multi-talented woman.                  
OL,21, A woman who fought the odds to prevent

OL,6, a descent into drugs and alcohol, and  
OL,7, to escape the demons that were with her
OL,8, since birth.                           
OL,10, She's still with us now, and the finale
OL,11, saw Liza belt out 'But The World Goes  
OL,12, Round'. She's showing sign of age and  
OL,13, previous health scars, of course, but  
OL,14, my overriding emotion was joy.         
OL,16, Through it all, that's exactly what    
OL,17, Liza has been, a bringer of joy!
