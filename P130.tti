OL,6, This week's telly: Julia - Sky         
OL,7, Atlantic; Hacks - Amazon Prime; Jimmy  
OL,8, Savile - A British Horror Story -      
OL,9, Netflix                                
OL,11, This week's viewing included a big     
OL,12, surprise for me - Julia (Sky Atlantic) 
OL,13, was a revelation! I'd briefly read that
OL,14, Sarah Lancashire was starring in this  
OL,15, USA made drama about telly cook Julia  
OL,16, Child - a figure I've only been        
OL,17, familiar with because of other dramas  
OL,18, and notes of her on TV past.           
OL,20, So I somewhat casually tuned in, to    
OL,21, check out if it was worth the time.

OL,6, Next thing I know, I am watching half  
OL,7, the series and four episodes in a row. 
OL,8, I loved it, an absolute triumph for    
OL,9, Lancashire - an actress I don't always 
OL,10, warm to!                               
OL,12, She's charming in the role, truly      
OL,13, transformed into someone else, and     
OL,14, inducing sympathy and love for Child.  
OL,16, It's also a mini Frasier reunion, with 
OL,17, David Hyde Pierce appearing as Paul    
OL,18, Child, and Bebe Neuwirth as Child's    
OL,19, friend. Both are stand out performers, 
OL,20, along with many other cast members -   
OL,21, engaging, funny, brilliant.

OL,7, It's a joy to stumble on something.    
OL,8, I can't wait to watch the rest now.    
OL,10, The same will be said of Hacks - I'm   
OL,11, hoping you say the same also! This is  
OL,12, my second viewing of this comedy drama,
OL,13, now that it's released on Amazon Prime.
OL,15, Easy digestible in half hour episodes, 
OL,16, Jean Smart is so brilliant as veteran  
OL,17, stand up comedian Deborah Vance, a     
OL,18, creation so superbly observed, with    
OL,19, careful detail in the back story, that 
OL,20, you almost believe her to be real.

OL,6, Deborah is reluctantly paired with a   
OL,7, young comedy writer, brought in to both
OL,8, write jokes with her, and document her 
OL,9, back catalogue.                        
OL,11, There's a personality clash from day   
OL,12, one, the basis of everything that      
OL,13, follows. It's spiky, hilarious,        
OL,14, poignant and intelligent - a genius    
OL,15, creation.                              
OL,17, Jean Smart has impressed me since the  
OL,18, days she appeared in Frasier, which    
OL,19, isn't a million miles from Deborah     
OL,20, Vance's personality.

OL,6, However, the most recent role I'd seen 
OL,7, her in prior to Hacks was as Kate      
OL,8, Winslet's Mum in Mare of Easttown - a  
OL,9, part far away from this one,           
OL,10, highlighting versatility, but the Vance
OL,11, personality type is definitely the one 
OL,12, that shines!                           
OL,14, With some trepidation, I ventured into 
OL,15, the limited series on Netflix, Jimmy   
OL,16, Savile - A British Horror Story!       
OL,18, Within minutes, it was clear that this 
OL,19, was indeed going to be a terrifying    
OL,20, look at this monster. Never mind red   
OL,21, flags, it's a sea of them here!

OL,6, Each and every clip highlights the     
OL,7, warnings that were always there, since 
OL,8, the 60s and 70s.                       
OL,10, How were so many signs missed?         
OL,12, Was everyone concerned so blinded by   
OL,13, his charming and funny oddness, hand in
OL,14, hand with the charity work that masked 
OL,15, so many terrible acts?                 
OL,17, I'm not even all the way through this  
OL,18, two part account, but I'm already open 
OL,19, mouthed and appalled by what it        
OL,20, details. How he got away with it all   
OL,21, still defies belief!
