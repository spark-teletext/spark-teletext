OL,6, This week's telly: The White Lotus -   
OL,7, Sky Atlantic; Jay's Yorkshire Workshop 
OL,8, - BBC2; Joe Lycett's Got Your Back -   
OL,9, Channel 4                              
OL,11, Sky Atlantic continues to be the home  
OL,12, of new quality drama from the HBO      
OL,13, stable. I'd heard good things about The
OL,14, White Lotus - and this week got the    
OL,15, chance to find out for myself.         
OL,17, Centring around the lives of the staff 
OL,18, and guests at a tropical resort in     
OL,19, Hawaii, it is off to a sharply comic   
OL,20, start and I loved it!

OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G2/6
OL,6, A rich cast of characters - played by  
OL,7, impressive actors like Connie Britton  
OL,8, and Murray Bartlett...with Jennifer    
OL,9, Coolidge already receiving top of her  
OL,10, game reviews for her role!             
OL,12, It's tone initially was the vacuous    
OL,13, rich, the shallow and bitchy types who 
OL,14, may well frequent such a place. It     
OL,15, reminded me in the character sense of  
OL,16, 'Succession' - in that it's a challenge
OL,17, to find anybody likeable amongst the   
OL,18, bunch of them!                         
OL,20, Like Succession, I think I'm going to  
OL,21, love it already.

OL,6, The first episode was already setting  
OL,7, us up for some inter-staff intrigue    
OL,8, power struggles, and issues between    
OL,9, guests. It's sure to turn up the heat  
OL,10, in the coming weeks!                   
OL,12, Jay's Yorkshire Workshop was perfectly 
OL,13, scheduled, following on BBC2           
OL,14, immediately after The Repair Shop on   
OL,15, BBC1.                                  
OL,17, Do we need this show, really? As much  
OL,18, as I like Jay and his helpers, it      
OL,19, definitely has a feel of the Golden    
OL,20, Goose. The BBC has been onto a winner  
OL,21, with The Repair Shop!

OL,6, They're going to naturally milk the    
OL,7, format for all it's worth.             
OL,9, It's a nice show, helping others with  
OL,10, some really impressive creations from  
OL,11, the skillset of the workshop. However, 
OL,12, it's formula - like The Repair Shop the
OL,13, focus is becoming more and more on the 
OL,14, sob story, every five minutes someone  
OL,15, is in tears - and haven't we seen      
OL,16, enough of this on our 'reality' shows? 
OL,18, That overloading of emotion seems to be
OL,19, seeping into everything on telly now - 
OL,20, I'm finding it increasingly offputting 
OL,21, on The Repair Shop.

OL,6, Yes, we do need these stories to an    
OL,7, extend, but it gets to daft levels of  
OL,8, blubbing now!                          
OL,10, Joe Lycett doesn't half make me laugh! 
OL,11, I've always enjoyed his stand up comedy
OL,12, his writing and was a bit late to the  
OL,13, party with the consumer show -         
OL,14, Joe Lycett's Got Your Back. Better late
OL,15, than never!                            
OL,17, I started watching last series and     
OL,18, thoroughly enjoyed the return - pre-   
OL,19, empted when I happened to see his stunt
OL,20, on Steph's Packed Lunch (pretending to 
OL,21, storm off the show.

OL,6, The whole intention was to spark       
OL,7, conversation around recycling          
OL,8, plastics).                             
OL,10, That stunt was revisited, with a       
OL,11, brilliant outcome from Yop drinks,     
OL,12, promising to change their packaging.   
OL,13, The programme is the perfect mix of    
OL,14, comedy and sharp consumer items.       
OL,15, You know as a viewer that Joe really   
OL,16, cares about the rights of the public   
OL,17, and the way he navigates these stories 
OL,18, is brilliant.It's the kind of programme
OL,19, that is a clever evolution. The likes  
OL,20, of Watchdog and Lynn Faulds-Wood never 
OL,21, had these laughs!
