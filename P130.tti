OL,6, This week's telly: Classic Coronation  
OL,7, Street (ITV3); Alan Carr's Adventures  
OL,8, with Agatha Christie (More4); Ambulance
OL,9, (BBC1)                                 
OL,11, Dear old Coronation Street is a soft   
OL,12, and fluffy old thing in so many ways,  
OL,13, but with a spine of steel running      
OL,14, through - from comedy moments that are 
OL,15, simply hilarious and laugh out loud    
OL,16, funny, through to tragedy played out in
OL,17, the most moving way, and shocking drama
OL,18, that takes your breath away.           
OL,20, I've been following Classic Coronation 
OL,21, Street for a while now.

OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G2/6
OL,6, Now, the reruns are up to early 2000s, 
OL,7, and the current storyline of most      
OL,8, interest is Alma Halliwell's cancer    
OL,9, diagnosis.                             
OL,11, I watched it first time around, but had
OL,12, forgotten how truly awful it was! Very 
OL,13, emotional and affecting, and utterly   
OL,14, without hope. Not something you would  
OL,15, usually expect from the Street!        
OL,17, It was a sledgehammer tactic, used to  
OL,18, encourage women to have smear tests,   
OL,19, and to keep their appointments. I'm not
OL,20, medical expert, but I've read criticism
OL,21, of the lack of realism -

OL,6, i.e. Alma missed an appointment, the   
OL,7, surgery messed up too, and then she is 
OL,8, diagnosed with cervical cancer that has
OL,9, spread, is inoperable and has three    
OL,10, months to live!                        
OL,12, Such shocking things do happen to      
OL,13, people of course, but my word it's     
OL,14, terrible to watch unfold. Really       
OL,15, upsetting, and fair play to the        
OL,16, brilliant writing and performances of  
OL,17, all involved!                          
OL,19, Apart from anything else, Alma was     
OL,20, always one of my favourite characters, 
OL,21, and I was very sorry to see her go.

OL,6, Especially like that!                  
OL,8, Quite the opposite in tone was Alan    
OL,9, Carr's Adventures with Agatha Christie 
OL,10, - hilarious as always, the show is     
OL,11, carried entirely by his jokes and      
OL,12, brilliant interactions with the public!
OL,14, I get the feeling Channel 4 shoved it  
OL,15, on More4 due to the subject matter -   
OL,16, top rating blockbuster it is not - but 
OL,17, it was a nice little show.             
OL,19, Nothing special, although a few choice 
OL,20, pieces of insight into the author, some
OL,21, great locations visited helped.

OL,6, And Alan's wisecracks makes it worth   
OL,7, the watch alone.                       
OL,9, Rounding off this week's selection,    
OL,10, Ambulance isn't a documentary I'd paid 
OL,11, much attention to before - but         
OL,12, obviously I knew what I was getting.   
OL,14, Following the North East Ambulance     
OL,15, Service, we followed the challenges of 
OL,16, staff shortages, and everything that   
OL,17, brings with it.                        
OL,19, You can feel the stress of each        
OL,20, situation unfolding, of the calls      
OL,21, mounting up, the ambulances queuing.

OL,6, There are scenes of trying to find     
OL,7, beds, all before they've even got into 
OL,8, the hospital!                          
OL,10, The most serious incident was a road   
OL,11, traffic accident, with a woman trapped 
OL,12, in the car and with severe head        
OL,13, injuries.                              
OL,15, It was gripping and awful at the same  
OL,16, time - with the after effect on        
OL,17, paramedics plain to see.               
OL,19, How amazing the NHS is, the incredible 
OL,20, people working within it - a timely    
OL,21, reminder for everyone seeing this.
