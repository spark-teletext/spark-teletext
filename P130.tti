OL,6, This week's telly: The Graham Norton   
OL,7, Show (BBC1); Strictly Come Dancing     
OL,8, (BBC1); Penelope Keith: From Margo To  
OL,9, The Manor Born (Channel 5)             
OL,11, Graham Norton is pretty silly isn't he,
OL,12, at least that's what my Mum said as we 
OL,13, watched this edition together!         
OL,15, With he and Jonathan Ross being the    
OL,16, only two hosts left with a traditional 
OL,17, type of chat show now, his is          
OL,18, definitely the preferred choice!       
OL,20, The choice of many class A celebs too -
OL,21, although not so much this week!

OL,6, This week's show didn't excite me much,
OL,7, the best guest in the line up being    
OL,8, Lesley Manville - due to star as       
OL,9, Princess Margaret in the next series of
OL,10, The Crown soon!                        
OL,12, It's a formula that works well though, 
OL,13, a feeling of comfort always washes over
OL,14, me, as the theme tune and opening      
OL,15, titles strike up.                      
OL,17, Let's see what this series brings,     
OL,18, cannot wait for the likes of Miriam    
OL,19, Margolyes to return, together with some
OL,20, newbies!

OL,6, Strictly Come Dancing is well and truly
OL,7, back in its stride again - the         
OL,8, juggernaut dominating the Saturday     
OL,9, night schedules once more.             
OL,11, It's one that is running out of steam  
OL,12, in some respects, I think. Each series 
OL,13, brings, for me, a higher element of    
OL,14, "Who is that?" And I don't think that  
OL,15, is just me getting older, I think it's 
OL,16, more like many celebs asked are saying 
OL,17, no.                                    
OL,19, They are really ramping it up on all   
OL,20, fronts now, but it's actually starting 
OL,21, to feel a bit more forced than fun.

OL,6, The sequins, the glitter, the fake tan,
OL,7, it's a uniform, rather than an         
OL,8, enhancement.                           
OL,10, And also, we are living in an age now  
OL,11, of being unable to criticise! Craig is 
OL,12, the only judge now who is likely to say
OL,13, a harsh word - but the boos get louder 
OL,14, and it all has to be so sanitised, in  
OL,15, order to not hurt anyone's feelings!   
OL,17, Camilla Long put it well about that in 
OL,18, the Sunday Times today, and I totally  
OL,19, agree - it's not unique to Strictly,   
OL,20, these days a competition cannot have   
OL,21, too much criticism, not a good thing!

OL,6, Penelope Keith: From Margo to Manor    
OL,7, Born - another week, another epic      
OL,8, Channel 5 documentary.                 
OL,10, Last week was June Whitfield and this  
OL,11, week another favourite of mine - dear  
OL,12, Dame Penelope!                         
OL,14, The Good Life was and remains one of   
OL,15, the finest comedies ever produced, and 
OL,16, much of its success is down to the     
OL,17, genius performance from Penelope Keith.
OL,19, It was great to see other appreciating,
OL,20, the talking heads and the clips from   
OL,21, the earliest days of her career.

OL,6, There were some clips from other       
OL,7, comedies over the years, some of which 
OL,8, I had forgotten all about (I'm looking 
OL,9, at you Executive Stress, and Next of   
OL,10, Kin - the latter was pretty bizarre and
OL,11, quite dark!), and of course a reminder 
OL,12, of the huge viewing figures To The     
OL,13, Manor Born achieved.                   
OL,15, Audrey was a fine comic creation, but  
OL,16, Margo trumps the lot. It was noted that
OL,17, Penelope was concerned about           
OL,18, typecasting, as any good actor must be.
OL,19, However, if you're going to be         
OL,20, associated forever with any part, you  
OL,21, could do a lot worse than her!
