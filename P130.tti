OL,6, This week's telly: Breakfast with      
OL,7, Stephen and Anne (GB News); Sunday with
OL,8, Laura Kuenssberg (BBC1); Talk TV       
OL,9, schedule                               
OL,11, I've decided to have a bit of a news   
OL,12, and current affairs theme this week!   
OL,13, The world of politics is in more       
OL,14, turmoil than ever, with a new Prime    
OL,15, Minister about to be announced, cost of
OL,16, living crisis, war in Ukraine, and     
OL,17, turbulent times across the world.      
OL,19, How do our news outlets portray this,  
OL,20, how do they provide a platform for     
OL,21, discussion?

OL,6, Breakfast with Stephen and Anne on GB  
OL,7, News is a programme that I never       
OL,8, thought I would be getting into!       
OL,10, GB News was not ever likely to be my   
OL,11, cup of tea, I thought. And I definitely
OL,12, don't subscribe to right wing views, to
OL,13, over the top nationalist leanings and  
OL,14, the like.                              
OL,16, However, if you put that aside, it     
OL,17, doesn't mean you cannot enjoy          
OL,18, programming on the channel. And anyway,
OL,19, it's good to sample all views and      
OL,20, opinions anyway, right?

OL,6, Anne Diamond is a broadcaster I have   
OL,7, always been a fan of, and for me she   
OL,8, makes this show. That's not wishing to 
OL,9, take away from Stephen Dixon, he's     
OL,10, great too. They make a warm and        
OL,11, comforting duo, in these troubled      
OL,12, times.                                 
OL,14, Also, they are really developing a     
OL,15, family feel about the show, with the   
OL,16, sports and showbiz reporters, the      
OL,17, newspapers reviewers, all showing a    
OL,18, real click of personalities.           
OL,20, As time as gone on, it's matured, grown
OL,21, a loyal following - and a difference.

OL,6, It's informative, but it's also        
OL,7, providing an escape from problems, with
OL,8, lighthearted items that are more than  
OL,9, welcome, and handled perfectly.        
OL,11, A breakfast show is a real success when
OL,12, you feel that you always want to start 
OL,13, your day with it. And my weekends now  
OL,14, are not the same if I don't start them 
OL,15, off with Stephen and Anne!             
OL,17, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg has been  
OL,18, mooted for a long time now, taking over
OL,19, from the departed Andrew Marr.         
OL,20, Recently, there's been a really        
OL,21, irritating trailer that I hated too.

OL,6, And here she is, the first show arrives
OL,7, - and even though I can find Laura     
OL,8, intensely irritating, with smugness off
OL,9, the chart, and a snippy style that     
OL,10, annoys - it was accomplished.          
OL,12, A genius combination of guests too -   
OL,13, the addition of Joe Lycett raised      
OL,14, plenty of laughs here, provided far    
OL,15, more fun than expected! The combination
OL,16, of Liz Truss and Laura was             
OL,17, breathtakingly horrendous of course,   
OL,18, but plenty of strong discussion and    
OL,19, soundbites for the news bulletins      
OL,20, abound!

OL,6, Finally, Talk TV! What's happening     
OL,7, there these days? With GB News finding 
OL,8, their feet and gaining from more       
OL,9, investment, where is this Murdoch owned
OL,10, channel heading?                       
OL,12, Several shows have been a flop,        
OL,13, struggles in viewing figures even for  
OL,14, supposed draw Piers Morgan.            
OL,16, There are some movements that may help 
OL,17, - Jeremy Kyle is launching a new       
OL,18, primetime show, and Vanessa Feltz      
OL,19, (after departing the BBC) is taking    
OL,20, over his slot. Will the channel        
OL,21, survive? It's not looking safe yet!
