OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G1/6
OL,6, This week's telly: Hubble: The Wonders 
OL,7, of Space Revealed (BBC4); Camilla's    
OL,8, Country Life (ITV); Judi Dench: Our    
OL,9, National Treasure (Channel 5)          
OL,11, As I write this, I am watching the sci 
OL,12, fi film Ad Astra, and I love all things
OL,13, cosmos - so a fitting first choice this
OL,14, week is the superb documentary Hubble: 
OL,15, The Wonders of Space Revealed.         
OL,17, I was totally transfixed by the wonder 
OL,18, and sense of adventure, and beauty, of 
OL,19, this programme. It captured the        
OL,20, enormity of such a plan, such a feat of
OL,21, engineering, a vision realised.

OL,6, With talking head tales from those     
OL,7, involved, from the ground up to those  
OL,8, on the missions to both launch Hubble  
OL,9, and fix her to see out her days.       
OL,11, It's interesting how scientific fact   
OL,12, and mythical wonder often collide and  
OL,13, there were moments of that here - the  
OL,14, need for one final mission because     
OL,15, Hubble had several parts malfunctioning
OL,16, at once. This was referred to 'as if   
OL,17, she knew'. Which goes against science  
OL,18, and the logical mind...but taps into   
OL,19, our imagination and fascinates even    
OL,20, more!

OL,6, It's with genuine excitement that I saw
OL,7, the shuttles take off, the space walks,
OL,8, the absolutely incredible photographs  
OL,9, that were a result of all this         
OL,10, investment, graft, faith and hope.     
OL,12, After so much enjoyment, I was left    
OL,13, with a side order of downbeat. Why,    
OL,14, with so much achieved, did the         
OL,15, investment stop, the shuttle missions  
OL,16, wound up? We talk about Mars now, the  
OL,17, Rover missions etc..when we've only    
OL,18, briefly visited the Moon. There is so  
OL,19, much more to do, yet it feels like so  
OL,20, much has stalled?

OL,6, HRH Duchess of the Cornwall certainly  
OL,7, hasn't stalled! She's on a roll these  
OL,8, days, winning fans in many places!     
OL,10, Camilla's Country Life was a welcome   
OL,11, piece...yes a puff piece, but such an  
OL,12, enjoyable one. As Camilla is guest     
OL,13, editor of the latest edition of Country
OL,14, Life (my Mum's a fan!), we followed her
OL,15, behind the scenes and enjoyed some     
OL,16, lovely moments with nearest and        
OL,17, dearest, celeb guests and staff, plus  
OL,18, many more.                             
OL,20, Having a launch event at Claridge's, it
OL,21, doesn't get any better than that!

OL,6, Just the sight of Royals and famous    
OL,7, folk milling through the beautiful     
OL,8, hotel was enough to make me swoon with 
OL,9, adoration for the programme. And Diana 
OL,10, may always have her place in history - 
OL,11, but Camilla has become somebody we     
OL,12, never expected, carving her own space  
OL,13, and she is so nice!                    
OL,15, She is somebody with a great sense of  
OL,16, humour, affection for the British      
OL,17, public, welcomed into the family. And  
OL,18, she shares something with Diana - the  
OL,19, ability to connect with anybody and    
OL,20, make them feel the sole focus!

OL,6, Judi Dench: Our National Treasure -    
OL,7, showed similar qualities in this fine  
OL,8, octogenarian wonder.                   
OL,10, I've loved Dame Judi since I was a kid,
OL,11, watching A Fine Romance with my family.
OL,12, It's only when you watch one of these  
OL,13, documentaries, with clip compilations  
OL,14, and celeb talking heads, that you      
OL,15, realise how many amazingly different   
OL,16, roles she has turned her hand to.      
OL,18, She is remarkable, and at 87 years old 
OL,19, remains relevant - with a cracking     
OL,20, sense of humour, and still relatable to
OL,21, the young! You are totally Dench!
