OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G2/6
OL,6, I was tuning into the festive soaps,   
OL,7, naturally. EastEnders served up the    
OL,8, usually turkey accompaniment of misery 
OL,9, and despair!                           
OL,11, Danny Dyer had announced some time ago 
OL,12, that he was leaving the London soap,   
OL,13, and it was no surprise that this was   
OL,14, the end for his character, Mick Carter.
OL,15, There are no surprises in soap these   
OL,16, days, which I find so disappointing!   
OL,18, The whole storyline around Mick, Janine
OL,19, and Linda has been disappointing.      
OL,20, Janine's been bad, but we've seen her  
OL,21, worse - and all the more fun for it!

OL,6, When the end came - a car chase, a     
OL,7, confrontation, whoops the car goes into
OL,8, the sea! It was clear what was coming  
OL,9, next, the ladies surviving and         
OL,10, Mick...not dead? Missing at sea!       
OL,12, I didn't like the nature of it, and    
OL,13, soaps don't normally do this. You don't
OL,14, usually get a 'missing, presumed dead' 
OL,15, outcome. They so often move away, leave
OL,16, in a taxi etc., but it needed to be    
OL,17, different for Mick, didn't it. We'll   
OL,18, see how Danny Dyer's career goes, he   
OL,19, may walk back in one day!              
OL,21, Christmas traditions on the box!

OL,6, Something I love to do is make some    
OL,7, final preparations, with Carols from   
OL,8, Kings on in the background - lovely    
OL,9, stuff!                                 
OL,11, And of course, this year, we had the   
OL,12, first Christmas message from The King! 
OL,13, This really did feel special to me. I  
OL,14, know I'm a Royalist, but for most of us
OL,15, it was a huge change. The season has   
OL,16, also naturally included reviews of the 
OL,17, year, programmes about the Queen's     
OL,18, passing, and it gave time to think     
OL,19, about the new era that's been ushered  
OL,20, in.

OL,6, Amongst the other Christmas specials - 
OL,7, Strictly and Call the Midwife (still   
OL,8, never watched the latter) - it's nice  
OL,9, to find those one off new gems.        
OL,11, The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the     
OL,12, Horse was a beautiful animation,       
OL,13, adapted from the bestselling book. A   
OL,14, lovely tale that showcases such talent 
OL,15, - the writing, the animation, with star
OL,16, voiceovers like Idris Elba, Tom        
OL,17, Hollander, and Gabriel Byrne. I'm sure 
OL,18, to watch this one again several times. 
OL,20, And Christmas is a time to catch up    
OL,21, too! I'm still planning on more!

OL,6, I want to binge watch BBC hit The      
OL,7, Traitors! I've heard so much about it, 
OL,8, but only seen a small portion!         
OL,10, And streaming platforms are awash with 
OL,11, festive fare, but I've been dipping in 
OL,12, to finish Harry and Meghan, and see    
OL,13, what's different about ITVX (not bad!).
OL,15, And now we have 2023 just around the   
OL,16, corner - with many shows flooding in.  
OL,17, First one that springs to mind is Happy
OL,18, Valley, the final series! Cannot wait! 
OL,19, And NYE itself will of course have the 
OL,20, Hootenanny, and a Sam Ryder special!   
OL,21, Have a lovely time, dear readers!
