OL,6, This week's telly: Platinum Jubilee    
OL,7, Special (BBC)                          
OL,9, Whether you're a fan of the Queen and  
OL,10, Royal Family or not, there's no        
OL,11, escaping the events of this long bank  
OL,12, holiday weekend!                       
OL,14, Personally, I am a fan, so I've been in
OL,15, my element - immersing myself in the   
OL,16, coverage. Most programming of interest 
OL,17, has been on the BBC - including themed 
OL,18, shows building up to the days e.g.     
OL,19, Morning Live, The One Show, jubilee    
OL,20, specials of shows like The Repair Shop 
OL,21, - always a winner with their choices.

OL,6, There was a Tower of London Beefeater  
OL,7, there, requesting a repair of a lantern
OL,8, going back to George V's day, still in 
OL,9, use today.                             
OL,11, Thursday came and the Trooping of the  
OL,12, Colour - what a spectacle to behold,   
OL,13, and it does make you proud, when you   
OL,14, see this kind of spectacle done so     
OL,15, well, for the world to see.            
OL,17, Not only that, the coverage was so     
OL,18, perfectly done, Huw Edwards at         
OL,19, Horseguards Parade, providing the      
OL,20, moment by moment commentary. However,  
OL,21, the triumphant return of Kirsty Young!

OL,6, One of my favourite presenters, Young  
OL,7, disappeared four years ago, due to ill 
OL,8, health - and now, she was back on our  
OL,9, screens in the best way possible.      
OL,11, Positioned in St James's Park, in a    
OL,12, waterside pagoda studio, joined by     
OL,13, guests like Dame Penelope Keith        
OL,14, (perfection!) and Alan Titchmarsh      
OL,15, (okay, you can't have everything!),    
OL,16, Young has clearly still got it, in     
OL,17, spade loads. I hope she has a regular  
OL,18, slot on screens ASAP!                  
OL,20, This culminated in Her Maj appearing on
OL,21, the Buck House balcony.

OL,6, This was not a certainty, with crowds  
OL,7, going wild to see her - joined by other
OL,8, members of the family, to view a moving
OL,9, flypast of seventy craft and a Red     
OL,10, Arrows display. Wonderful! And little  
OL,11, Prince Louis stole the show, hilarious 
OL,12, facial expressions - it was a joy to   
OL,13, see him, his siblings and parents, the 
OL,14, future of the Royal Family!            
OL,16, That evening, Kirsty was back, to      
OL,17, introduce a recap of the morning -     
OL,18, and the lighting of the beacons,       
OL,19, beginning with the Queen starting the  
OL,20, illumination of the Buckingham Palace  
OL,21, beacon...

OL,6, Progressing with a nationwide tour of  
OL,7, lighting and a real joining together of
OL,8, communities.                           
OL,10, Friday, and the Service of Thanksgiving
OL,11, at St Paul's - which the Queen could   
OL,12, not attend, due to discomfort during   
OL,13, the previous day. What a woman, at 96, 
OL,14, still being able to do any of it!      
OL,16, The service was a great opportunity for
OL,17, 'I Spy', as Harry and Meghan made their
OL,18, first public appearance, since giving  
OL,19, up royal life. After all the bother, it
OL,20, was rather nice to see them there.     
OL,21, Thinking of what might have been!

OL,6, St Pauls cathedral was just            
OL,7, breathtaking, I was reminded of how    
OL,8, vast it is, what an occasion.          
OL,10, And as I write this, I'm watching      
OL,11, Platinum Party at the Palace! A change 
OL,12, of mood from the pageantry of my       
OL,13, previous postings - a fun line up of   
OL,14, acts, performing in front of the       
OL,15, Palace.                                
OL,17, I'm loving the mix of Queen, Craig     
OL,18, David, Jax Jones, Rod Stewart and      
OL,19, anticipating the divine Miss Diana Ross
OL,20, before long too! God save the Queen!
