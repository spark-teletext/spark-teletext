OL,8, (Drama); Love Your Weekend with Alan   
OL,9, Titchmarsh (ITV)                       
OL,11, I've always been a fan of Chris Ramsey,
OL,12, always makes me chuckle and he seems   
OL,13, like a great guy. Somebody to always   
OL,14, put a smile on your face! I've seen his
OL,15, stand up show, when he visited Norwich,
OL,16, and it was hilarious! He's a real      
OL,17, talent!                                
OL,19, Also, very down to Earth and 'real'!   
OL,20, This bears out when talking about his  
OL,21, wife Rosie too! They're so likeable.

OL,6, Having teamed up now, for a highly     
OL,7, popular podcast, their stock is high!  
OL,8, So high, that the BBC rewards them with
OL,9, a chat type show.                      
OL,11, I wasn't sure if this would be as great
OL,12, as hoped, but dipped into it this week.
OL,13, The most famous guests were Martin and 
OL,14, Shirlie Kemp - again a likeable couple 
OL,15, (although, with their son Roman, they  
OL,16, are EVERYWHERE).                       
OL,18, I can't say I was overly impressed.    
OL,19, They're fun, I like them, but it was   
OL,20, pretty forced fun! A sequence with a   
OL,21, link to a fellow comic was there.

OL,6, She was trying not to be sick,         
OL,7, recounting a viewer tale, and Chris was
OL,8, rolling around on the studio floor.    
OL,9, They kind of lost me at that point.    
OL,10, Maybe another time, worth another try? 
OL,12, I've mentioned the classic soap        
OL,13, episodes previously on this page,      
OL,14, during lockdowns they were great fun to
OL,15, watch and I have maintain this -       
OL,16, checking in to my time machine when    
OL,17, possible!                              
OL,19, Classic EastEnders is currently showing
OL,20, on Drama, episodes from 2000. It was a 
OL,21, peak era in Albert Square!

OL,6, Dan Sullivan was baddie number one,    
OL,7, Peggy was going through the aftermath  
OL,8, of breast cancer - and was at the helm 
OL,9, of the Vic with Frank Butcher!         
OL,11, Iconic characters like Frank and Peggy,
OL,12, Roy and Pat, Dot Cotton, were all      
OL,13, there. It reminds me that EastEnders   
OL,14, just doesn't have this now, the shift  
OL,15, has gone younger and younger - and is  
OL,16, that right?                            
OL,18, Soaps need older lynchpins, the glue   
OL,19, that hold them together as the         
OL,20, generations below them grow and learn, 
OL,21, and letting them go is dangerous.

OL,6, Of course, people die, but replace     
OL,7, these figures with senior authorities  
OL,8, please?                                
OL,10, Yes, all soaps need to build a new     
OL,11, fanbase with younger viewers, but don't
OL,12, underestimate their ability to be      
OL,13, interested in older people!

OL,17, cookery based programmes to demand we

OL,6, for the first time properly. Dear old  
OL,7, (and he is getting on) Alan Titchmarsh 
OL,8, is wandering around a sprawling country
OL,9, property.                              
OL,11, He chats to different minions about the
OL,12, gardening of course, and taps into food
OL,13, and hobbies - with guests sprinkled    
OL,14, around the place.                      
OL,16, This week, Gabby Logan and Ardal       
OL,17, O'Hanlon are there - plus Dame Judi    
OL,18, Dench no less, quite a coup there! It's
OL,19, ideal for lazy viewing, yet hilariously
OL,20, forced - tables of uneaten croissants  
OL,21, and jugs of orange juice cluttering!
