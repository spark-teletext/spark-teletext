OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G1/6
OL,6, This week's telly: Nolly (ITVX); The   
OL,7, Real Nolly (ITVX); Crossroads (YouTube)
OL,9, If you were a Crossroads fan, this     
OL,10, week's telly has been heaven for you!  
OL,11, Personally, I was a massive fan -      
OL,12, although my age meant that I only came 
OL,13, to it during it's final years.         
OL,15, I watched during the 1985 Nicola       
OL,16, Freeman period, through to 1987 and    
OL,17, Tommy Lancaster and his family...and   
OL,18, finally to the Crossroads, Kings Oak   
OL,19, changes and those final days before the
OL,20, axe fell. We won't get into the early  
OL,21, 2000s revival today!

OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G2/6
OL,6, It's only since that I've read up on   
OL,7, and become so familiar with the Noele  
OL,8, Gordon years that preceded. You can't  
OL,9, be a fan, without knowing how it all   
OL,10, began and what made the Richardson     
OL,11, family tick, led by matriarch Meg.     
OL,13, I knew the history, that Noele had been
OL,14, sacked, that it was all rather cruel - 
OL,15, and it appeared to essentially break   
OL,16, her heart and kill her.                
OL,18, Which brings us to Nolly, to use her   
OL,19, nickname to friends and loved ones.    
OL,20, Russell T Davies - who once wrote a    
OL,21, trial script for the soap - is a genius

OL,6, He's breathed new life into Noele's    
OL,7, story, and brought back the characters 
OL,8, and what made Crossroads the juggernaut
OL,9, it once was.                           
OL,11, It's a story of a star, incredibly     
OL,12, popular, and how insecure and arrogant 
OL,13, men sought to cut her down, without    
OL,14, even truly knowing what the impact     
OL,15, would be.                              
OL,17, It's a tale of regret too - tinged with
OL,18, such sadness, because the producer who 
OL,19, railed against her could have made it  
OL,20, all so different. And, in fact, he     
OL,21, brought her back in 1983...

OL,6, And that probably would have been      
OL,7, permanent, were it not for her cancer  
OL,8, diagnosis and death in 1985. Such a    
OL,9, cruel and tragic end. It's perfectly   
OL,10, told, and I'm blown away by the casting
OL,11, and recreation, it seems so real.      
OL,13, The perfect follow up is the           
OL,14, accompanying documentary - The Real    
OL,15, Nolly. It's great to see the actual    
OL,16, woman, and accounts from those who knew
OL,17, her well. Anne Diamond is a valuable   
OL,18, contributor, and these accounts prove  
OL,19, to be so moving.                       
OL,21, Russell T Davies himself appears.

OL,6, He tells the story so well - naturally,
OL,7, after immersing himself. The man is a  
OL,8, genius, pitch perfect writing that     
OL,9, appeals to so many. And Helena Bonham- 
OL,10, Carter - who is incredible as Nolly in 
OL,11, the drama - fittingly narrates here.   
OL,13, And finally, once you've watched these,
OL,14, your love for the Midlands soap need   
OL,15, not end there.                         
OL,17, YouTube - as is often the case -       
OL,18, contains many delights for fans of many
OL,19, genres.                                
OL,21, There's hour upon hour of Crossroads!

OL,6, So I've got cracking on some old Nolly 
OL,7, era episodes, and it's heaven, you can 
OL,8, really lose yourself for some time!    
OL,10, Although, we always come full circle   
OL,11, don't we? I still found myself then    
OL,12, seeking out episodes from the mid-80s  
OL,13, to the end. Watching Nicola Freeman    
OL,14, revamp the place, making Jill Chance   
OL,15, feel out of place..and then Tommy      
OL,16, Lancaster breathing some Brummie magic 
OL,17, into it.                               
OL,19, So much potential, yet they wanted it  
OL,20, dead. If things had been different,    
OL,21, Crossroads would still be here now...
