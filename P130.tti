OL,6, This week's telly - MOTD:Uefa Euros    
OL,7, 2020 - BBC1; Kathy Burke: Money Talks -
OL,8, Channel 4; The Handmaid's Tale -       
OL,9, Channel 4                              
OL,11, Well, I have to open with a mention of 
OL,12, last Sunday night's dramatic events of 
OL,13, course! Footy isn't usually my bag, but
OL,14, even I got caught up in the final and  
OL,15, was immersed in the BBC coverage.      
OL,17, The excitement was ramped up intensely 
OL,18, and it really was event TV and         
OL,19, something uniting people - let's face  
OL,20, it, we all need some of that after this
OL,21, past year.

OL,6, England's goal two minutes in gave us  
OL,7, all such hope didn't it - with Gary    
OL,8, Lineker and co almost exploding in the 
OL,9, studio!                                
OL,11, Of course, we all know the result and  
OL,12, it was a downbeat end to the tournament
OL,13, for England and all viewers. I cycled  
OL,14, home from my friends', passing         
OL,15, downhearted folks also making their    
OL,16, way. It's important to remember that   
OL,17, takeaway thought - television does     
OL,18, unite people.                          
OL,20, Kathy Burke: Money Talks is also       
OL,21, something that unites -

OL,6, Episode one of her two part documentary
OL,7, focused on the 'haves' and this second 
OL,8, episode was very much about the 'have  
OL,9, nots'.                                 
OL,11, Kathy herself came from a deprived     
OL,12, background and we all know her to be so
OL,13, down to Earth - and all the better for 
OL,14, it. The great thing is, unlike some,   
OL,15, she's happy talking to anyone and does 
OL,16, not judge - if you're a decent person, 
OL,17, who gives a....                        
OL,19, There were many fine points made in    
OL,20, this programme - many of which most of 
OL,21, us are more than aware of.

OL,6, It's important to keep having the      
OL,7, conversation, or nothing ever changes. 
OL,8, As she noted, when she was growing up  
OL,9, in a poor household, they weren't      
OL,10, judged in the same way as today. 'These
OL,11, days, if you're poor, you're really    
OL,12, made to feel like scum.' A sad state of
OL,13, affairs, that does ring true.          
OL,15, I've always been aware of Jaywick, the 
OL,16, former holiday overspill for the closed
OL,17, Clacton Butlins - a closure that meant 
OL,18, it descended into the run down         
OL,19, environment it is today. Seeing the    
OL,20, former 'high street' was shocking!

OL,6, Boarded up shops and partially         
OL,7, collapsed buildings, the poor are kept 
OL,8, poor by being unable to travel to the  
OL,9, nearest supermarket, having to pay     
OL,10, double for their loaf of bread at a    
OL,11, corner store. As Kathy said, just a    
OL,12, Tesco here would help so much!         
OL,14, It was a sorry sight...but people like 
OL,15, Kathy highlighting these stories gives 
OL,16, me hope for the future of places like  
OL,17, Jaywick.                               
OL,19, There's less hope around in The

OL,6, Even though June's journey is still    
OL,7, feeling hopeless - thwarted at every   
OL,8, turn, in new and more horrifying ways! 
OL,10, Recent episodes have ramped up the     
OL,11, death count, with the Gilead regime    
OL,12, becoming harsher and more violent. How 
OL,13, will June and her counterparts ever get
OL,14, out of this?                           
OL,16, I wonder how many more episodes are in 
OL,17, this, ahead of it running out of steam 
OL,18, completely, when we get Gilead fatigue!
OL,20, A while longer I'd say, because I'm not
OL,21, done with June yet either!

OL,6, Elisabeth Moss has to be one of the    
OL,7, finest actors today, moving and        
OL,8, uplifting and holds the attention so   
OL,9, much in every scene she appears in.    
OL,11, How far she has come since Mad Men - I 
OL,12, really hope she gets the chance, after 
OL,13, proving how well she can play despair, 
OL,14, to be able to play a happy ending for  
OL,15, this powerful character.               
OL,17, Margaret Atwood's novel was left behind
OL,18, long ago, the success of the series    
OL,19, inevitably meaning more episodes. Which
OL,20, was the right thing, a society like    
OL,21, Gilead has never been more relevant!
