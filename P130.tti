OL,6, This week's telly: Countryfile (BBC1); 
OL,7, Antiques Roadshow (BBC1); Flackstock   
OL,8, (Sky Max/Showcase)                     
OL,10, There's a lot to be said for tradition.
OL,11, These days, post-pandemic and with the 
OL,12, cost of living crisis ever present in  
OL,13, the news, it's even more important to  
OL,14, have plenty we can rely on, to have a  
OL,15, lynchpin that provides confidence and  
OL,16, support.                               
OL,18, Countryfile has been around a long time
OL,19, now, and this week's episode was one   
OL,20, that included the original presenter - 
OL,21, dear ol' John Craven!

OL,6, I was pleased to see him there, rather 
OL,7, than Matt 'something of the night'     
OL,8, Baker at the helm.                     
OL,10, Am sure he's a lovely chap, but there's
OL,11, something about him I really don't     
OL,12, like, no getting away from it. Not so  
OL,13, with our John, who has still got it    
OL,14, when it comes to a presenter of quality
OL,15, and gravitas!                          
OL,17, Together with random guests, it's a    
OL,18, genuinely informative and enlightening 
OL,19, watch for a Sunday eve. A mix of       
OL,20, agriculture - talking to landowners    
OL,21, about concerns over wild fires.

OL,6, The recent heatwave and climate change 
OL,7, is a big deal, with an important       
OL,8, platform here.                         
OL,10, Include other items both serious and   
OL,11, lighthearted, top it off with a weather
OL,12, forecast for the week ahead, and you   
OL,13, have a reliable recipe for the show.   
OL,15, Around even longer, and of comfort as a
OL,16, programme always, always on a Sunday   
OL,17, night from childhood - Antiques        
OL,18, Roadshow.                              
OL,20, I can't imagine this never being there 
OL,21, - and these days, who hosts?

OL,6, Yes, old smug chops, Fiona Bruce is at 
OL,7, the helm.                              
OL,9, Another presenter that I can't say I'm 
OL,10, a big fan of. However, Fiona does the  
OL,11, job well - co-ordinating this          
OL,12, travelling juggernaut, steering the    
OL,13, public towards the antiques experts in 
OL,14, a deft way.                            
OL,16, I'm a fan also of the segment that was 
OL,17, never part of the old school show -    
OL,18, Good, Better, Best - presenting three  
OL,19, different items (diamond rings this    
OL,20, week) and inviting the public to decide
OL,21, the ascending order of value.

OL,6, Which, let's face it, is the reason we 
OL,7, all love this show - roll out the      
OL,8, antiques, discuss them in detail...but 
OL,9, when all is said and done, how much are
OL,10, they worth?!                           
OL,12, It's comfort telly for a Sunday eve,   
OL,13, and I absolutely loved it!             
OL,15, Flackstock was not something I expected
OL,16, to see this week. A documentary,       
OL,17, charting the planning and reality of a 
OL,18, festival dedicated to the memory of    
OL,19, Caroline Flack.                        
OL,21, Superbly constructed, in every way.

OL,6, It captured superbly the desire to     
OL,7, create an event that did Caroline      
OL,8, justice, that celebrated her life,     
OL,9, reflected her zest for life, and also  
OL,10, raised awareness for mental health     
OL,11, charities, and the importance of       
OL,12, discussing mental health much more.    
OL,14, Her friends are movingly passionate and
OL,15, determined, serving to highlight the   
OL,16, wonderful network that she left behind.
OL,18, What a wonderful job they did, with    
OL,19, performances of the best music, and    
OL,20, also creating a place of love and      
OL,21, understanding - she would love it!
