OL,11, I've long been a fan of a Ryan Murphy  
OL,12, created show. Ever since the days of

OL,15, production - from Bette and Joan, to

OL,6, FX shows are moving to Disney+, with   
OL,7, series nine and ten being the first of 
OL,8, 'AHS' to make that transfer.           
OL,10, This time around was delayed due to    
OL,11, Covid and is finally with us - 'Double 
OL,12, Feature', as the name suggests, is     
OL,13, split into two parts and part one has  
OL,14, been a delight.                        
OL,16, One of the highest quality of the      
OL,17, anthologies, we're taken to the bleak  
OL,18, setting of Provincetown in part one    
OL,19, (Red Tide) - a clapperboard town by the
OL,20, sea.

OL,6, Finn Wittrock's character Harry and his
OL,7, wife Doris (Lily Rabe) move to the     
OL,8, town, pursuing their creative outlets  
OL,9, of writing and interior design.        
OL,11, A case of writer's block is solved when
OL,12, Harry is offered a little black pill,  
OL,13, otherwise known as 'the Muse'.         
OL,15, I don't want to reveal too much, but   
OL,16, what follows is the usual rollercoaster
OL,17, ride of thrills and creative scares    
OL,18, that we have come to expect.           
OL,20, However, maybe the delay has upped the 
OL,21, ante - it's more considered.

OL,6, It's not as bonkers this time around,  
OL,7, not grasping at straws and meaning     
OL,8, threads of the story become too        
OL,9, chaotic!                               
OL,11, I'm not starting part two, Death       
OL,12, Valley, and looking forward to what    
OL,13, lies ahead!                            
OL,15, Who Do You Think You Are was in my     
OL,16, manor this week - following Ed Balls   
OL,17, ancestry in Norwich and Norfolk. It was
OL,18, a thrill to see the sights of Norwich  
OL,19, Castle, the Guildhall, the Market and  
OL,20, familiar place names dotted around his 
OL,21, family tree.

OL,6, He's a likeable chap, making for an    
OL,7, enjoyable peek through the ages. The   
OL,8, tale of his ancestor's trial at Norwich
OL,9, Castle was quite gripping, crime and   
OL,10, intrigue on my doorstep!               
OL,12, Many series in now, it's a programme   
OL,13, that can still throw up surprises and -
OL,14, understandably - it's appeal very much 
OL,15, depends on the subject and their family
OL,16, tree.                                  
OL,18, BBC4 so often delights and has now     
OL,19, brought us a daily slice of something  
OL,20, different - relaxing and embracing some
OL,21, solitude.

OL,6, During this week, episodes have        
OL,7, followed Amanda Owen, Alistair         
OL,8, Campbell, Kate Botley, Nihal and more -
OL,9, around Cumbria, the Peaks,             
OL,10, Northumberland, on their Winter Walks. 
OL,12, It's a novel concept, alone with a go  
OL,13, pro, wandering with thoughts spoke out 
OL,14, loud to us, to themselves. Also,       
OL,15, Ordnance Survey co-ordinates flashing  
OL,16, up on screen for locations, encouraging
OL,17, us to retrace those very steps.        
OL,19, We need more of this type of programme,
OL,20, with other such 'celebs', it's         
OL,21, different, and true public service!
