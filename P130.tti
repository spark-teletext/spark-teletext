OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G1/6
OL,6, This week's telly: Lynch/Oz (Sky       
OL,7, Store); The Graham Norton Show (BBC1); 
OL,8, Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street      
OL,9, Legacy (Sky Store)                     
OL,11, Something a little different again this
OL,12, week. It's tempting to still focus     
OL,13, sometimes on reviewing linear          
OL,14, television.                            
OL,16, However, as we all know, it's about so 
OL,17, much more than that these days -       
OL,18, streaming, timeshift watching, and also
OL,19, purchasing one off gems - something I  
OL,20, have done more of lately.

OL,6, I'm a huge David Lynch fans - love all 
OL,7, of his films, and Twin Peaks is the    
OL,8, greatest TV show ever, in my eyes.     
OL,10, Lynch/Oz is a fascinating exploration  
OL,11, of the influence of The Wizard of Oz in
OL,12, his work, and the links back to this   
OL,13, classic film.                          
OL,15, I was astounded by just how many links 
OL,16, there are, it was remarkable! And one  
OL,17, of those lightbulb moments, that made  
OL,18, perfect sense in many instances. Of    
OL,19, course a director would have some      
OL,20, inspirations.

OL,6, Like background references to the red  
OL,7, shoes, some incredibly subtle touches  
OL,8, that need to be pointed out. Whereas   
OL,9, other references are blindingly obvious
OL,10, - such as Sheryl Lee's turn as The Good
OL,11, Witch in Wild at Heart.                
OL,13, By the time it was over, the           
OL,14, realisation dawns on the viewing - and 
OL,15, it's pointed out - that every director 
OL,16, has influences that filter through each
OL,17, and every film they make.              
OL,19, For a fan like me, jewels like this can
OL,20, be found randomly by trawling through.

OL,6, Sky Store does sometime have some real 
OL,7, rare finds, that I haven't seen        
OL,8, elsewhere!                             
OL,10, The Graham Norton Show has been a      
OL,11, juggernaut again, hurtling through a   
OL,12, run and reaching the highlights bookend
OL,13, of a series. It's never off screen for 
OL,14, long though!                           
OL,16, I cannot say, even after regularly     
OL,17, watching it, that Graham Norton is one 
OL,18, of my faves! However, it's a show that 
OL,19, gets brilliant guests - proper A list  
OL,20, stars!

OL,6, Some of the clearly love being a guest 
OL,7, so much, they return time and time     
OL,8, again.                                 
OL,10, Those who are particularly good value  
OL,11, have been back for this run - Judi     
OL,12, Dench, Salma Hayek, Daniel Craig and   
OL,13, more - providing some laugh out loud   
OL,14, moments too.                           
OL,16, This series has also brought together  
OL,17, some amazing combinations - which spark
OL,18, off the best of conversations.         
OL,19, This is the key to success, people we  
OL,20, would not see together, loving each    
OL,21, other's company.

OL,6, Seeing Cate Blanchett and Margot Robbie
OL,7, - both there to promote major Hollywood
OL,8, movies of the moment - were on the same
OL,9, sofa as Beverley Knight and Alan Carr. 
OL,11, And it works, it shows you how down to 
OL,12, Earth some of these Hollywood stars can
OL,13, be. And also how the likes of Knight   
OL,14, and Carr can clearly hold their own in 
OL,15, such company also!                     
OL,17, Alan is always one of my favourite     
OL,18, people, and to see him cracking jokes  
OL,19, and telling stories that make an       
OL,20, admired actress like Blanchett giggle  
OL,21, is a wonderful thing about television!
