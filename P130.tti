OL,6, This week's telly: Classic EastEnders  
OL,7, (Drama); Thatcher: A Very British      
OL,8, Revolution (BBC4); Wimbledon (BBC)     
OL,10, It's been a while since I have         
OL,11, mentioned it, but I still watch Classic
OL,12, EastEnders on Drama as often as I can -
OL,13, sometimes a binge watch catch up       
OL,14, session!                               
OL,16, Today I had one of those catch ups, and
OL,17, what a doozy it was in this batch! The 
OL,18, fantastic storyline that began with    
OL,19, Frank and Peggy, Roy and Pat, and Terry
OL,20, and Irene, heading on holiday together 
OL,21, to sunny Spain!

OL,6, Frank and Pat rekindled their decades  
OL,7, long romance during the trip, fighting 
OL,8, the urges on their return to Walford,  
OL,9, and inevitably keeping the fling going.
OL,11, For weeks, taking risks, almost getting
OL,12, caught - ultimately planning to run    
OL,13, away together!                         
OL,15, It all came to a complex head,         
OL,16, following a number of twists and turns,
OL,17, on Guy Fawkes night in the Queen Vic.  
OL,18, Peggy discovered what had been going   
OL,19, on, and humiliated both Frank and Pat  
OL,20, in front of the customers - ending in a
OL,21, slap around the chops for both of them!

OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G3/6
OL,6, It was edge of the seat exciting, very 
OL,7, well written and acted, and unlike     
OL,8, anything EastEnders is producing these 
OL,9, days, sadly!                           
OL,11, Apologies for the repetition, but I    
OL,12, just had to mention Thatcher: A Very   
OL,13, British Revolution for a second time.  
OL,14, Due to the fact that, in a twist of    
OL,15, unexpected scheduling, the final       
OL,16, episode about her resignation was      
OL,17, broadcast in the same week that Boris  
OL,18, Johnson resigned!                      
OL,20, BBC4 couldn't have planned it better if
OL,21, they had tried to!

OL,6, This ending for Maggie was gripping,   
OL,7, the talking heads like Bernard Ingham, 
OL,8, Kenneth Baker and Norman Tebbit        
OL,9, painting a picture of a woman who lived
OL,10, for nothing else but the role of PM.   
OL,12, It was a tragic tale, highlighting that
OL,13, even she had to admit defeat and the   
OL,14, loss of confidence for her in the      
OL,15, cabinet, the party, the country.       
OL,17, She wasn't my cup of tea, but by jove  
OL,18, she was a towering figure in history   
OL,19, that we will never forget!

OL,6, The documentary series showed us how,  
OL,7, even with a self assured politician    
OL,8, like Thatcher, power can be stripped   
OL,9, away from a PM as quickly as it can be 
OL,10, granted.                               
OL,12, People rejoiced when she left of       
OL,13, course, but we were reminded of all the
OL,14, surrounding facets that may have faded 
OL,15, over the years.                        
OL,17, Wimbledon returned once more this      
OL,18, month, to a Britain heating up nicely  
OL,19, for summer, thank you very much!       
OL,21, I like a bit of the annual tradition.

OL,6, However, I'm a little out of touch with
OL,7, the new stars of the sport, so this    
OL,8, year has been rather exciting!         
OL,10, Changes are afoot as well, with Sue    
OL,11, Barker having her final year of        
OL,12, presenting duties, announcing her      
OL,13, retirement.                            
OL,15, It does feel like a new era at the     
OL,16, tournament, but at the same time being 
OL,17, secured for the future.                
OL,19, It's hard to imagine anything but the  
OL,20, superb, quality BBC coverage in place  
OL,21, every year, long may it continue.
