OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G1/6
OL,6, This week's telly: An Audience with    
OL,7, Adele - ITV; I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out
OL,8, of Here - ITV; Remarkable Places to Eat
OL,9, - BBC2                                 
OL,11, ITV certainly had a winner on their    
OL,12, hands this week, and they knew it -    
OL,13, heavily promoted in the preceding days,
OL,14, a juggernaut of an entertainment       
OL,15, special.                               
OL,17, An Audience with Adele was worth the   
OL,18, wait. Having been unconvinced by her   
OL,19, new album yet, the programme was a     
OL,20, comeback that had to convince us all   
OL,21, that she still had that magic touch.

OL,6, It was soon apparent - she did!        
OL,8, What an enjoyable show this was - Adele
OL,9, is engaging and down to Earth, laughing
OL,10, and joking with crowd, interacting with
OL,11, ease. As for the voice - belting out   
OL,12, her back catalogue and new tracks, I   
OL,13, have to say I was blown away by her    
OL,14, talent pretty quickly.                 
OL,16, We were treated to added delights -    
OL,17, Emma Thompson hilariously grooving in  
OL,18, the crowd, totally wild abandon on     
OL,19, display! Also, Alan Carr (good friends 
OL,20, with Adele) plugged a gap by singing on
OL,21, her behalf - I loved it, he's so funny.

OL,6, Add into the mix a tearful reunion with
OL,7, a school teacher, then this            
OL,8, extravaganza had it all!               
OL,10, As I write this, I'm A Celebrity Get Me
OL,11, Out of Here is a show in crisis - an   
OL,12, edition pre-recorded due to Storm      
OL,13, Arwen, Richard Madeley has left after  
OL,14, falling ill and breaking the Covid     
OL,15, bubble - what else will befall this    
OL,16, year's series?                         
OL,18, Back in the castle for another year,   
OL,19, after the pandemic prevented a jungle  
OL,20, return, the programme actually feels   
OL,21, refreshed and revitalised by that.

OL,6, I feel that the castle venue lends     
OL,7, itself perfectly to the format and     
OL,8, presents plenty of fresh challenges to 
OL,9, the contestants - it must be so cold,  
OL,10, for starters!                          
OL,12, Eating challenges are always a winner  
OL,13, of course and I saw one with two       
OL,14, complete strangers taking part (an     
OL,15, Emmerdale actor and BBC Radio DJ it    
OL,16, turns out!) - and there's something    
OL,17, satisfying about seeing someone having 
OL,18, to down such horrendous items. I still 
OL,19, think I could do that!                 
OL,21, I may keep tuning in, you know!

OL,6, If only to find out how all of these   
OL,7, scuppering curve balls pan out - and   
OL,8, that must all be helping with          
OL,9, publicity!                             
OL,11, Remarkable Places to Eat was one I was 
OL,12, looking forward to - having always been
OL,13, a fan of Angela Hartnett....and Fred   
OL,14, Sirieix is ...okay.                    
OL,16, They travelled to Venice, somewhere I  
OL,17, travelled to years ago and have fond   
OL,18, memories of.                           
OL,20, Yet, I didn't actually make it to the  
OL,21, end of the programme, I must confess!

OL,6, Disappointingly, the content just      
OL,7, didn't grab me - it felt disjointed and
OL,8, chaotic.                               
OL,10, Maybe I should revisit this on iPlayer 
OL,11, - programmes sometimes warrant that    
OL,12, kind of check - to see if I discover a 
OL,13, different angle and mood.              
OL,15, There are so many cuisine focused shows
OL,16, these days, it's hard to select the    
OL,17, ones worth spending your time on.      
OL,19, I'll do it for Angela..and try again   
OL,20, next week too!
