OL,6, This week's telly: When Ruby Wax Met - 
OL,7, BBC2; The Handmaid's Tale - Channel 4; 
OL,8, Alex Polizzi: My Hotel Nightmare -     
OL,9, Channel 5                              
OL,11, I was over the moon this week, to see a
OL,12, welcome revisit to Ruby Wax's brilliant
OL,13, 90s celebrity interviews!              
OL,15, I was a huge fan of these, still       
OL,16, harking back to the moments of hilarity
OL,17, from her banter with the likes of Liza 
OL,18, Minelli and David Gest, Carrie Fisher, 
OL,19, Sharon Stone - the sheer bizarre and   
OL,20, out of place scenarios that each       
OL,21, programme created.

OL,6, I totally appreciate that Rubes is not 
OL,7, everyone's cup of tea - quite the      
OL,8, opposite, many of my friends actively  
OL,9, despise her.                           
OL,11, Not me, I've always admired her - and  
OL,12, recent updates like an appearance on   
OL,13, Who Do You Think You Are opened my eyes
OL,14, to her family history and made me      
OL,15, admire her even more - it's a miracle  
OL,16, she is as sane as she is!              
OL,18, Also, I saw her make a live appearance 
OL,19, at Latitude and also in a Norwich      
OL,20, theatre show - promoting her new book  
OL,21, and talking about her world now.

OL,6, These days, she's mainly occupied with 
OL,7, psychotherapy and writing and advising 
OL,8, on mental health - she was absolutely  
OL,9, brilliant!                             
OL,11, This adds context to going back in     
OL,12, time, to these 90s gems of When Ruby   
OL,13, Wax Met. Episode one's stand out may   
OL,14, well have been Donald Trump.           
OL,16, A get together beginning on his private
OL,17, jet, discussing his hopes of becoming  
OL,18, president of all things, it was        
OL,19, awkward! Ruby, looking back on footage,
OL,20, explains...

OL,6, There was no 'warm up' meeting, as with
OL,7, other celebs - and he did not take to  
OL,8, her at all. Plus, her nerves were      
OL,9, getting the better of her, meaning she 
OL,10, babbled even more manically than usual!
OL,12, This and other classic clips, made for 
OL,13, the ultimate retro revelling for me -  
OL,14, and I cannot wait until part two       
OL,15, tonight!                               
OL,17, The Handmaid's Tale reached its        
OL,18, conclusion, after a triumphant series  
OL,19, four. Each time, I don't feel they will
OL,20, be able to stretch it beyond the       
OL,21, previous point - but they do.

OL,6, Thanks to the evocative nature of the  
OL,7, locations, photography, brilliant      
OL,8, writing and acting.                    
OL,10, The whole cast is so impressive -      
OL,11, Elisabeth Moss being top of that list  
OL,12, of course! She blows me away with each 
OL,13, episode, heart-breaking and infuriating
OL,14, and amusing all at once.               
OL,16, In this final instalment, June utilised
OL,17, her armoury and assistance available to
OL,18, ensure that Commander Waterford would  
OL,19, be served justice. When it came, it was
OL,20, incredibly fitting and left the drama  
OL,21, on a real high point.

OL,6, What can happen next in June's battle  
OL,7, to both overcome Gilead and escape it? 
OL,8, One thing is certain, I will be there  
OL,9, for it!                                
OL,11, Another series coming to an end was the
OL,12, three part run of Alex Polizzi: My     
OL,13, Hotel Nightmare. Her joint venture with
OL,14, mother Olga finally opened - after     
OL,15, months of challenges, budget overrun   
OL,16, and Covid!                             
OL,18, There was the inevitable last minute   
OL,19, panic to get everything finished, the  
OL,20, mistakes made on opening day and       
OL,21, desperation to put things right -

OL,6, the viewer will have never seen Alex so
OL,7, panicked!                              
OL,9, Her mother Olga certainly wasn't (the  
OL,10, show could have been called My         
OL,11, Nightmare Mother), as she completed the
OL,12, room designs with steely determination.
OL,13, Alex hasn't got anything on Mum in the 
OL,14, scary business leader stakes!          
OL,16, The end result was a triumph, it looked
OL,17, so beautiful and a place I'd love to   
OL,18, stay in, first class! Not only that,   
OL,19, another first occurred - Alex blubbing 
OL,20, her way through a speech to staff - it 
OL,21, really had been a battle won.
