OL,11, Well, my my my, it's been a jam packed 
OL,12, summer of sport on telly, hasn't it?!  
OL,14, One after the other, Wimbledon, Tour de
OL,15, France, Women's Euros and now the      
OL,16, Commonwealth Games from Birmingham! I  
OL,17, read that last bit in a Brummie accent,
OL,18, by the way!                            
OL,20, Sporting events aren't usually my      
OL,21, thing, but sometimes I am sold.

OL,6, If the event is high profile enough, I 
OL,7, am likely to check it out further. And 
OL,8, of course, if an opening ceremony is   
OL,9, impressive enough, then it remains a   
OL,10, sold memory! Look at the 2012 Olympics 
OL,11, - amazing!                             
OL,13, The Commonwealth Games opening ceremony
OL,14, had some fantastic moments, that truly 
OL,15, impressed. Great spectacles, such as   
OL,16, the giant bull. Some truly comedic and 
OL,17, very British moments, such as Joe      
OL,18, Lycett's superb quipping!              
OL,20, Also, the passing of the baton ended in
OL,21, a wonderful way -

OL,6, Max Whitlock being lifted on circles of
OL,7, glass. I felt scared for him, then     
OL,8, thought it was ridiculous, then thought
OL,9, it was wonderful.                      
OL,11, Duran Duran, the Brummie band of       
OL,12, multiple hits and part of the UK music 
OL,13, legacy of the 80s and beyond, turned   
OL,14, out some of the hits and....well, I've 
OL,15, seen them perform better! Bit of a bum 
OL,16, note to end on there, sorry!           
OL,18, Neighbours: The Finale has been coming 
OL,19, or a while and I was gearing up for it 
OL,20, massively, considering I haven't       
OL,21, watched regularly since the Nineties!

OL,6, I prepared myself, as I am sure many   
OL,7, others have, by starting to watch the  
OL,8, daily episodes in advance.             
OL,10, It's proved to be a happy and light and
OL,11, fluffy show, much like it always was!  
OL,12, It would be easy to criticise, because 
OL,13, it's pretty naff, the acting isn't     
OL,14, always that great - but it's likely a  
OL,15, modern version of what we always got   
OL,16, anyway!                                
OL,18, Oh hang on though, is that Clive       
OL,19, Gibbons? Is that Jane Harris? Some     
OL,20, former cast members were already part  
OL,21, of the show again...

OL,6, Others like Harold Bishop had been     
OL,7, paying their visits well in advance.   
OL,9, The finale double episode itself was a 
OL,10, delight, very well done, something for 
OL,11, the fans to revel in for sure!         
OL,13, I felt my heart skip a beat when Scott 
OL,14, and Charlene re-entered Ramsay Street, 
OL,15, it was a really exciting moment! And   
OL,16, the inclusion of a ghostly Madge and   
OL,17, Doug was delicately handled - and this,
OL,18, with Susan Kennedy's monologue wrapping
OL,19, up brought a tear to the eye!          
OL,21, A Royal Guide To Fashion rounded off

OL,6, the selection this week - it's almost  
OL,7, getting amusing now that Channels 4 or 
OL,8, 5 will always have a Royal doc on      
OL,9, Saturday nights!                       
OL,11, I wasn't expecting anything much from  
OL,12, this, but it was worth sticking with   
OL,13, and an insightful look into the history
OL,14, of Royal tailoring, choice of outfits  
OL,15, and more. Who makes them? Which members
OL,16, of the family have their own style and 
OL,17, rebel against conformity (I think we   
OL,18, know one was Margaret, don't we?)?     
OL,19, There were some interesting history    
OL,20, notes and lessons in Royal code that   
OL,21, made it well worth catching after all!
