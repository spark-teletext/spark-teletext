OL,6, Easy to love too, with a gentle and    
OL,7, kind nature striking through cutting   
OL,8, and witty humour.                      
OL,10, A motor home beckons again, reminding  
OL,11, me of Miriam's tour of Australia and   
OL,12, also her stint in The Real Marigold    
OL,13, Hotel. Naturally, talk turned straight 
OL,14, away to the toilet - I wouldn't expect 
OL,15, anything less!                         
OL,17, In that sense, there is a danger of    
OL,18, these series becoming a bit samey...but
OL,19, the top qualities more than make up for
OL,20, it.

OL,6, Another bug bear of mine is that most  
OL,7, programmes now have to drive us to     
OL,8, break down in tears, to focus          
OL,9, excessively on personal tragedies. Why 
OL,10, does it have to be this way, yes it's a
OL,11, fact of life but can we not have some  
OL,12, escape?                                
OL,14, Yet this was delicately done, there was
OL,15, a very emotional and personal moment,  
OL,16, when they visited Alan's childhood     
OL,17, home. He'd suffered growing up with a  
OL,18, cold and cruel father - the pain was   
OL,19, clear to see. He couldn't enter the    
OL,20, house, just the grounds were painful   
OL,21, enough. It was poignant.

OL,6, And very moving - and Miriam was a     
OL,7, rock, whilst being moved herself. I'm  
OL,8, looking forward to next time already!  
OL,10, "Richaaaaaard!" The familiar cry of    
OL,11, Hyacinth Bucket (with a silent T) rings
OL,12, out once more, this time with a repeat 
OL,13, run from series one, episode one. BBC4 
OL,14, continues the comedy classics, with    
OL,15, Keeping Up Appearances.                
OL,17, This Roy Clarke penned masterpiece is  
OL,18, akin to the formula we grew used to, if
OL,19, it ain't broke don't fix it!           
OL,21, The writing is witty and sharp,

OL,6, peppered with those familiar tales of  
OL,7, 'candlelight suppers' and 'my          
OL,8, Sheridan'. Let's not forget either that
OL,9, Patricia Routledge is a genius and her 
OL,10, performance is a tour de force.        
OL,12, Not only can she rattle off those lines
OL,13, perfectly and with such convincing     
OL,14, characterisation, but she's a very     
OL,15, physical comedienne - falling into     
OL,16, bushes, running around, she literally  
OL,17, threw herself into the part! Amazing!  
OL,19, Speaking of throwing - Midnight Mass on
OL,20, Netflix is something that may cause you
OL,21, to throw something in fright!

OL,6, I finished this spooky series and      
OL,7, highly recommend the creepy goings on  
OL,8, in this church centric island          
OL,9, community.                             
OL,11, The story unfolds nicely, at a perfect 
OL,12, pace - and I won't give anything away  
OL,13, here, but suffice to say by the time   
OL,14, you're done, your jaw will have dropped
OL,15, several times over!                    
OL,17, It has some of the great horror        
OL,18, hallmarks - and a fine cast who will   
OL,19, help keep you gripped throughout the   
OL,20, twists and turns...until the almost    
OL,21, apocalyptic ending is laid bare.
