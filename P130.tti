OL,6, This week's telly: Married At First    
OL,7, Sight Australia - E4; RKO Night - BBC4;
OL,8, Breakfast With Stephen and Anne - GB   
OL,9, News                                   
OL,11, I've been lagging behind on a guilty   
OL,12, pleasure of late! I have got very into 
OL,13, previous series of Married At First    
OL,14, Sight Australia, but this time just not
OL,15, got round to watching.                 
OL,17, After several friends have raved about 
OL,18, how good the latest E4 series is, cue  
OL,19, me binge watching and trying to catch  
OL,20, up on a LOT of content!

OL,6, Each series has many episodes- up to   
OL,7, forty - with at least an hour length.  
OL,8, That's a commitment, but I can cut a   
OL,9, few corners, fast forward the endless  
OL,10, recaps that they like to do following  
OL,11, each ad break etc.                     
OL,13, Guilty pleasure is the best way to     
OL,14, describe it! There is so much wrong    
OL,15, with the programme, on many levels.    
OL,17, An array of characters, some of them   
OL,18, intensely irritating, a real love to   
OL,19, hate personality mix. That's the beauty
OL,20, of the show! The 'experts' have chosen!

OL,6, Not only those who will be a romantic  
OL,7, fit, but those who will make for great 
OL,8, telly too!                             
OL,10, Only five episodes in as I write (it's 
OL,11, actually on in the background), and I  
OL,12, am hooked!                             
OL,14, The idiotic premise, the desperation   
OL,15, from the participants, the personality 
OL,16, clashes and the genuine moments of     
OL,17, hilarity - both intentional and        
OL,18, otherwise!                             
OL,20, Plus I get to enjoy the relationship   
OL,21, expert Mel Schilling once more.

OL,6, I just love her little quotes and      
OL,7, asides, as everything unfolds!         
OL,9, BBC Four is one of my fave channels.   
OL,10, Faced with budget constraints, and tied
OL,11, to a level of repeats, the powers that 
OL,12, be are proving to be cleverly creative 
OL,13, with their scheduling!                 
OL,15, Evenings of classic comedy delight -   
OL,16, Keeping Up Appearances, The Good Life, 
OL,17, Yes Prime Minister etc. Another feature
OL,18, is the use of themed evenings, this    
OL,19, week including RKO Night.

OL,6, Kicking off with the start of The RKO  
OL,7, Story documentary series, charting the 
OL,8, history of the studio, way back in the 
OL,9, silent days and through to 'talkies'!  
OL,10, Followed by a showing of a classic!    
OL,11, The 1933 King Kong, featuring Fay Wray 
OL,12, in the clutches of our frequently aped 
OL,13, (!) giant gorilla lead!                
OL,15, Watching films like this now is a      
OL,16, revelation, wonderful in both their    
OL,17, simplicity and also in how they broke  
OL,18, ground, paving the way for so much     
OL,19, more.

OL,6, Finally in this evening of delights -  
OL,7, The Thing From Another World (1951) - a
OL,8, film familiar from it's opening titles,
OL,9, which were mimicked by John Carpenter's
OL,10, 1982 remake.                           
OL,12, Another classic, ahead of it's time,   
OL,13, and thank you BBC4, for I'm grateful   
OL,14, when 'repeats' means 'treasure trove'  
OL,15, to me!                                 
OL,17, I will end with a mention of GB News'  
OL,18, Breakfast with Stephen & Anne at the   
OL,19, weekend - I find myself starting to    
OL,20, enjoy this show! Great presenting team 
OL,21, and cosy feel.

OL,6, The experienced team makes all the     
OL,7, difference here.                       
OL,9, Stephen Dixon was on Sky News for      
OL,10, twenty years, and Anne Diamond being   
OL,11, pioneer of breakfast telly in the 80s  
OL,12, with TV-am. They have good chemistry   
OL,13, and rapport with each other, they make 
OL,14, it look effortless.                    
OL,16, And the show is gradually building a   
OL,17, family feel and a loyal following. Dare
OL,18, I say it, but could GB News be getting 
OL,19, into its stride now? I'll be watching  
OL,20, TalkTV's Monday launch, and wondering  
OL,21, how the two may co-exist?
