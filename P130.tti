OL,6, This week's telly: Mr Bates vs The Post
OL,7, Office (ITV1); The Crown (Netflix); The
OL,8, Morning Show (Apple TV+)               
OL,10, It's the return of Sparky! Sorry I have
OL,11, been away so long, dear readers! I hope
OL,12, you missed me, I sure missed you!      
OL,14, Straight back into it, after a bit of a
OL,15, lacklustre festive season's fare on the
OL,16, telly!                                 
OL,18, This week, ITV1 has tapped into the    
OL,19, scandal that stirred up across over    
OL,20, twenty years in the Post Office. Mr    
OL,21, Bates vs The Post Office is superb!

OL,6, Toby Jones leads a fine cast,          
OL,7, portraying the sheer horror of so many 
OL,8, running post offices being falsely     
OL,9, accused of theft - because of computer 
OL,10, error!                                 
OL,12, Surely this is a warning bell for the  
OL,13, upcoming days of AI, if this can happen
OL,14, now, what on Earth will be in store    
OL,15, then?                                  
OL,17, I found myself watching open mouthed,  
OL,18, the terrible injustice of it all! These
OL,19, poor people, not helped by anyone in   
OL,20, authority. It's heartbreaking to think 
OL,21, that some people accused are gone.

OL,6, I could detail each of the cases       
OL,7, portrayed, but the only way is to watch
OL,8, the whole series and get the full      
OL,9, picture. Then watch the documentary,   
OL,10, see the news reports....               
OL,12, News reports are something that will   
OL,13, have always educated us when it comes  
OL,14, to royal events too - and now, it's    
OL,15, over! The Crown, that is, it's hard to 
OL,16, believe this juggernaut of Peter       
OL,17, Morgan's creation is no more.          
OL,19, To give a final teasing, series six was
OL,20, released in two halves. Part one -     
OL,21, Princess Diana.

OL,6, The build up to her death in Paris was 
OL,7, painfully slow and a parody in some    
OL,8, ways, bordering on the ridiculous. Yet,
OL,9, it was gripping, and Elizabeth Debicki 
OL,10, was both caricature and genius. I hated
OL,11, it, and I loved it.                    
OL,13, Part two had a different tone, and this
OL,14, is when Imelda Staunton really came    
OL,15, into her own - for the first time in   
OL,16, this series.                           
OL,18, The episode focusing on The Queen and  
OL,19, Princess Margaret's relationship is one
OL,20, of the most moving I have ever seen.   
OL,21, Lesley Manville is also fantastic.

OL,6, Bravo to all at The Crown, we'll miss  
OL,7, you.                                   
OL,9, Finally this time, I've become an      
OL,10, addict of this final show. I'd heard a 
OL,11, bit of a buzz around the third series  
OL,12, of The Morning Show on Apple, starring 
OL,13, Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon.
OL,15, Nah, I thought at first, it's not      
OL,16, likely to be that great. However, as   
OL,17, soon I started this, I am hooked! I'm  
OL,18, currently bingeing and into series two 
OL,19, now - what a show, gripping, great     
OL,20, storylines and Aniston is better than  
OL,21, she's ever been. Check it out now!
