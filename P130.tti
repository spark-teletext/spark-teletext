OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G1/6
OL,6, This week's telly: Dragons' Den - BBC1;
OL,7, The Apprentice - BBC1; You Are What You
OL,8, Eat - Channel 5                        
OL,10, As we head further into 2022, we find  
OL,11, ourselves entering the routine of new  
OL,12, and regular programmes.                
OL,14, And three of those familiar feel       
OL,15, programmes on our screens have returned
OL,16, now, linking together our days through 
OL,17, grey old January and beyond!           
OL,19, Dragons Den enters its gazillionth     
OL,20, series, yet I feel - and many may      
OL,21, disagree - that's it's still fresh!

OL,6, This may not have been the case, had   
OL,7, the makers not changed the line up of  
OL,8, Dragons over the years.                
OL,10, Tall, charismatic Peter Jones remains, 
OL,11, along with long term (and possibly my  
OL,12, all time fave) Deborah Meaden, Sara    
OL,13, Davies has proven very watchable       
OL,14, (recently twirling around on           
OL,15, Strictly!), and Touker Souleyman -     
OL,16, perhaps last on the list for me, but he
OL,17, provides some entertaining moments but 
OL,18, I still can't quite take him seriously 
OL,19, as an entrepreneur.                    
OL,21, This time around, there's more change!

OL,6, Social media boss Steven Bartlett is   
OL,7, the young newbie and boy, do we know   
OL,8, about it!                              
OL,10, He's quickly making his presence felt, 
OL,11, stealing a march on other Dragons,     
OL,12, unsettling them and showing lots of    
OL,13, charm and wit - it's making for a      
OL,14, better watch already!                  
OL,16, BBC1 naturally follows this, with the  
OL,17, umpteenth series of The Apprentice!    
OL,18, Lord Sugar's motley crew are back      
OL,19, again...and it's er, not so fresh!     
OL,21, The same ol' challenges, oh yes.

OL,6, The same ol' interchangeable           
OL,7, personalities...same ol' judging style 
OL,8, (Claude's temporary replacement, Tim   
OL,9, the first winner = nice but dull), same
OL,10, ol' one liners by ol' Sid James        
OL,11, lookalike himself!                     
OL,13, Yet I still watch it! Proof positive   
OL,14, that you can milk a format dry and     
OL,15, folks will always tune in...but for how
OL,16, much longer?                           
OL,18, Remember Gillian McKeith, peeking into 
OL,19, boxes of poo?! Well, I do, and You Are 
OL,20, What You Eat returned to our screens - 
OL,21, this time under the watch of Trisha!

OL,6, Ms Goddard is a host I have always     
OL,7, found extremely warm and engaging..and 
OL,8, she could be the making of this return.
OL,10, New Year always brings the same parade 
OL,11, of programmes.                         
OL,13, People succumb to the cliches of a new 
OL,14, year - losing weight, trying to have a 
OL,15, new look, making resolutions.          
OL,17, The industries and the media attached  
OL,18, to this suck everyone in time and time 
OL,19, again, it keeps a production line going
OL,20, - in more ways than one.

OL,6, That said, programmes like this can    
OL,7, serve a valuable purpose. They can lend
OL,8, a helping hand, showing many lost      
OL,9, people the way forward.                
OL,11, One of the subjects in this edition was
OL,12, one such prime example - she had a     
OL,13, front at the ready, showing the world  
OL,14, what she wanted them to see, her       
OL,15, vulnerability only displayed when      
OL,16, Trisha gently prodded and pressed at   
OL,17, the surface.                           
OL,19, Even though sometimes they can seem to 
OL,20, be exploiting folk, if they help one   
OL,21, person, isn't that a good thing?
