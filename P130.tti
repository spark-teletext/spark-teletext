OL,6, This week's telly: Succession - Sky    
OL,7, Atlantic; Impeachment: American Crime  
OL,8, Story - BBC2; Halloween (2018) - BBC4  
OL,10, What a week! My number one drama       
OL,11, Succession has returned, for its third 
OL,12, series!                                
OL,14, Hotly anticipated - not just by me -   
OL,15, and also delayed due to Covid of       
OL,16, course, the series opener was          
OL,17, incredible. I was tempted to stay up   
OL,18, until 2am, to watch the simulcast with 
OL,19, the USA premiere, but Sky Atlantic     
OL,20, scheduled for 9pm the next evening     
OL,21, also.

OL,6, We left the Logan family and Waystar   
OL,7, Royco empire in turmoil, as Kendall had
OL,8, turned on his father. A nice touch was 
OL,9, the fact that the episode picked up    
OL,10, exactly where we left off, rather than 
OL,11, a six months later scenario.           
OL,13, I'd rewatched, for the third time, the 
OL,14, first two series ahead of this. The    
OL,15, quality is so high, incredible acting, 
OL,16, witty and sharp writing, keeping       
OL,17, viewers on their toes too.             
OL,19, Series creator Jesse Armstrong was     
OL,20, behind Peep Show, and the genius touch 
OL,21, is ever present.

OL,6, The characters are despicable, but it  
OL,7, works, you love to hate them and the   
OL,8, chinks of vulnerability and humanity   
OL,9, show more as time goes on.             
OL,11, My own favourite is the patriarch,     
OL,12, Logan Roy played by Brian Cox - an     
OL,13, actor of amazing talent. His presence  
OL,14, and one liners cut through every scene 
OL,15, and he's definitely series lynchpin, am
OL,16, hoping it does not continue without    
OL,17, him, at any stage. Watch it - now!     
OL,19, If you'd watched previous American     
OL,20, Crime Stories - OJ Simpson and Versace,
OL,21, you'll be familiar with the magic.

OL,6, Ryan Murphy creates hypnotic telly,    
OL,7, from a stellar cast - and Impeachment  
OL,8, looks to be no exception!              
OL,10, The set up is instantly in motion -    
OL,11, Beanie Feldstein cutting a vulnerable  
OL,12, figure, as Monica Lewinsky.            
OL,14, It's clear that this story is going to 
OL,15, be focused on her manipulation at the  
OL,16, hands of Linda Tripp. In padded suit,  
OL,17, helmet wig, big glasses, the genius of 
OL,18, Sarah Paulson makes a big impression   
OL,19, instantly.                             
OL,21, This is going to be one to watch.

OL,6, The OJ series hit the heights, with    
OL,7, Versace more of a hit and miss at      
OL,8, times...but stick with it, I feel there
OL,9, are great moments to come.             
OL,11, It's a little early for spooks and     
OL,12, ghouls, but BBC4's rescheduled showing 
OL,13, of the 2018 Halloween film caught my   
OL,14, eye late at night.                     
OL,16, I'd caught it at the cinema, and got   
OL,17, pulled into another look here. Jamie   
OL,18, Lee Curtis reprises her role as Laurie 
OL,19, Strode, grizzled and worn out by the   
OL,20, way her life has gone since the events 
OL,21, of 1978 - when she was hunted.

OL,6, Her serial killer brother, Michael     
OL,7, Myers, of course returns to Haddonfield
OL,8, on his favourite evening of the year.  
OL,10, I didn't expect great things at first, 
OL,11, but it's a high quality film. The      
OL,12, standard of scares and acting is high. 
OL,13, His initial escape and unstoppable run 
OL,14, of killing is genuinely effective - and
OL,15, I was definitely scared in key scenes! 
OL,17, I love a Halloween fright or two, so   
OL,18, enjoyed revisiting the world of a      
OL,19, creepy classic - watch this space next 
OL,20, week for more on offer during the      
OL,21, season of the witch!
