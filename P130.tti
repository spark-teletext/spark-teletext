OL,6, This week's telly: Coronation Street   
OL,7, Icons: Norris Cole - ITV; Jo Brand -   
OL,8, BBC4; All Creatures Great and Small -  
OL,9, Channel 5                              
OL,11, There was a time I was glued to        
OL,12, Coronation Street - these days, it's   
OL,13, the classic episodes from 1999 that    
OL,14, capture my imagination.                
OL,16, Coronation Street Icons: Norris Cole   
OL,17, marked the off screen death of this    
OL,18, long standing character. I wouldn't    
OL,19, exactly call him an icon though!       
OL,21, Norris was amusing, a nosy busybody

OL,6, character - first appearing as someone 
OL,7, to wind up Derek and Mavis...and pretty
OL,8, irritating they all could be!          
OL,10, This evolved to him being alongside    
OL,11, Rita in The Kabin for years....and then
OL,12, working with potty Mary and making us  
OL,13, cringe throughout.                     
OL,15, Don't get me wrong, he had some        
OL,16, brilliant scenes and lines - but we    
OL,17, aren't talking towering legend in my   
OL,18, eyes. Present day Corrie is losing its 
OL,19, way - and some of these tribute shows  
OL,20, are evidence of that.

OL,6, His death was handled                  
OL,7, bizarrely...awkward scenes with Ken and
OL,8, Rita seeming more their age than ever, 
OL,9, not in a comfortable way...it makes me 
OL,10, sad for the whole show.                
OL,12, Jo Brand fans had two BBC4 shows to    
OL,13, enjoy on Tuesday. Imagine: Jo Brand, No
OL,14, Holds Barred and Born Lippy: Mark      
OL,15, Lawson Talks To Jo Brand. I am one of  
OL,16, those fans!                            
OL,18, The documentary traced her life and    
OL,19, career - her life has been fascinating,
OL,20, with her history as a mental health    
OL,21, nurse actually being a choice career.

OL,6, Her laid back manner and sense of      
OL,7, humour saw her through some horrendous 
OL,8, experiences, with her path into comedy 
OL,9, one of hard graft in stand up and an   
OL,10, almost reluctant path to greater       
OL,11, celebrity.                             
OL,13, Born Lippy was heaven, listening to her
OL,14, witty retorts when questioned about her
OL,15, views and commentating on the road her 
OL,16, career has travelled over the decades. 
OL,17, Those who only know her from the Bake  
OL,18, Off spin off show must have had a      
OL,19, shock!                                 
OL,21, Jo has mellowed over the years.

OL,6, However, there are always signs of that
OL,7, razor wit, cutting tongue and huge     
OL,8, intellect.                             
OL,10, Ee up, veterinary's back again! All    
OL,11, Creatures Great and Small (the reboot) 
OL,12, returned to Channel 5 this week, like a
OL,13, comfort blanket being wrapped around   
OL,14, the viewer for a second series.        
OL,16, It really did feel like that, being    
OL,17, transported back to the Dales and these
OL,18, much loved characters, brought to live 
OL,19, convincingly and in neat little stories
OL,20, each episode.

OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G6/6
OL,6, Samuel West is the star of the show    
OL,7, here, his portrayal of Siegfried Farnon
OL,8, is the gruff portrayal we'd expect     
OL,9, (especially when recalling Robert Hardy
OL,10, in the 80s version).                   
OL,12, Yet, he has developed the part into a  
OL,13, multi-faceted man, with real heart and 
OL,14, vulnerability, humanity...which is what
OL,15, this tale is all about.                
OL,17, Who'd have thought that Channel 5 would
OL,18, end up being the comfy place to come   
OL,19, for a new version of this show, Our    
OL,20, Yorkshire Farm and other programmes    
OL,21, transporting us to the best of country?
