OL,6, This week's telly: Married At First    
OL,7, Sight UK - E4; Prince Philip: The Royal
OL,8, Family Remembers - BBC1; 73rd Annual   
OL,9, Primetime Emmy Awards - Sky Max        
OL,11, It took me a little while to catch on, 
OL,12, about as long as it did for the        
OL,13, Australian version - but I am now fully
OL,14, invested in Married At First Sight UK! 
OL,16, Yes, it's trash, it's a pure guilty    
OL,17, pleasure! The format in the UK was     
OL,18, originally dull as ditchwater, but with
OL,19, this revamp comes more drama - hence it
OL,20, becomes great telly!

OL,6, The concept - couples are matched by   
OL,7, relationship experts and then marry in 
OL,8, a faux ceremony, having never clapped  
OL,9, eyes upon one another!                 
OL,11, As the weeks go on, they spend time on 
OL,12, honeymoon, living together, meeting    
OL,13, each other's family - all expedited to 
OL,14, condense the experiment and get to know
OL,15, each other fast!                       
OL,17, It's gripping! The dinner parties and  
OL,18, commitment ceremonies (deciding if they
OL,19, want to stay another week) kicked off  
OL,20, beautifully, just as they did in the Oz
OL,21, version.

OL,6, They even shipped in Mel Schilling, an 
OL,7, Aussie expert, who pitches her         
OL,8, commentary perfectly and lends more to 
OL,9, the show that you first think!         
OL,11, Couples fall for each other, couples   
OL,12, fall out, it's a rollercoaster! And I  
OL,13, am smitten!                            
OL,15, Prince Philip: The Royal Family        
OL,16, Remembers was such a well made         
OL,17, documentary. Apparently beginning as a 
OL,18, celebration of the Duke's 100th        
OL,19, year...but ending of course as a       
OL,20, remembrance.

OL,6, Many members of the Royal Family were  
OL,7, interviewed - and it made for          
OL,8, fascinating viewing. We don't very     
OL,9, often see Princesses Beatrice and      
OL,10, Eugenie, Lady Louise Mountbatten-      
OL,11, Windsor...nor even Earl and Countess of
OL,12, Wessex for that matter, very often on  
OL,13, our screens.                           
OL,15, You can think what you like about him  
OL,16, and the Royals, but the programme      
OL,17, perfectly pitched a man who led an     
OL,18, impressive life and did contribute a   
OL,19, lot to the country.

OL,6, It also came across how much his family
OL,7, meant to him - and vice versa. Of      
OL,8, course, the only voice really missing  
OL,9, was that of the Queen.                 
OL,11, It was noted that his loss would be    
OL,12, huge for her...but that she would also 
OL,13, be able to carry on without him. And as
OL,14, a viewer, both of those statements seem
OL,15, so true. Poignant and interesting!     
OL,17, The 73rd Annual Primetime Emmy Awards  
OL,18, played out on the rebranded Sky Max    
OL,19, entertainment channel. Fine            
OL,20, entertainment it was - seemingly a     
OL,21, scaled down ceremony.

OL,6, Yet, almost like pre-pandemic times.   
OL,7, With guests in LA and also London (a   
OL,8, raucous room, mainly occupied by the   
OL,9, cast of The Crown - wish I'd been at   
OL,10, that party!) it was a glittering affair
OL,11, and just as impressive as the Oscars.  
OL,13, The quality of television reflects     
OL,14, this, the likes of HBO producing movie 
OL,15, standard and budget fare these days.   
OL,17, I almost gave a standing ovation when  
OL,18, The Crown swept several awards -       
OL,19, Gillian Anderson never disappointing. A
OL,20, USA press question later asked her if  
OL,21, she'd consulted with Margaret Thatcher.

OL,6, She'd died years ago of course, but    
OL,7, Gillian deftly and politely swerved    
OL,8, this with a no, ahead of moving on.    
OL,10, I think I've shared before that I do   
OL,11, love an awards show - and I think part 
OL,12, of that is the thrill of seeing people 
OL,13, receiving credit where it's due. The   
OL,14, emotion pouring out, realising a dream 
OL,15, long held and on a peer pedestal.      
OL,17, Of course there are hilarious moments  
OL,18, and gaffs too, plus high and mighty    
OL,19, arrogance on display too. All great    
OL,20, entertainment I might add!
