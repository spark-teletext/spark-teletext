OL,6, This week's telly: Celebrity MasterChef
OL,7, - BBC1; Write Around the World With    
OL,8, Richard E Grant - BBC4; Alex Polizzi:  
OL,9, My Hotel Nightmare - Channel 5         
OL,11, I usually refuse to watch MasterChef or
OL,12, the celebrity version, I'm afraid I    
OL,13, find it difficult to endure Gregg      
OL,14, Wallace! Am sure he's a lovely bloke in
OL,15, real life, but we all have our dislikes
OL,16, for telly hosts, don't we?             
OL,18, However, the trailers were teasing me, 
OL,19, with clips of the hilarious Su Pollard 
OL,20, tempting me in! I tried to fight it,   
OL,21, but had to dive in!

OL,6, I was quickly loving it! Gregg who?    
OL,8, Su Pollard was great value, as I knew  
OL,9, she would be. Her random singing and   
OL,10, roaring with laughter had me in        
OL,11, stitches!                              
OL,13, Also in the A-list, no B-list....er, C?
OL,14, We saw Rita Simons, Duncan James       
OL,15, (looking like Rylan or David Gest with 
OL,16, his dramatic dark dyed hair, brows and 
OL,17, beard!)...and Bez!                     
OL,19, There were some impressive dishes on   
OL,20, display, I have to say - meaning I did 
OL,21, take more interest in all aspects.

OL,6, Not just the celeb banter here, the    
OL,7, food was interesting and surprising    
OL,8, too! Hearing Bez talk about his love of
OL,9, South American food was enlightening to
OL,10, say the least!                         
OL,12, It very much depends on who the celeb  
OL,13, mix is, but I imagine I'll be tuning in
OL,14, again!                                 
OL,16, Write Around the World With Richard E  
OL,17, Grant is one I have to review again for
OL,18, the second episode - if only to note   
OL,19, that it was even better than the first!
OL,21, This time we were taken to France!

OL,6, The content was really engaging -      
OL,7, Richard visited Carol Drinkwater -     
OL,8, former actress (All Creatures Great &  
OL,9, Small) turned novelist.                
OL,11, Her story of moving to France, becoming
OL,12, the owner of an olive farm, embracing  
OL,13, the Mediterranean diet and lifestyle - 
OL,14, and writing novels set in the area and 
OL,15, amongst the olive groves.              
OL,17, She'd had a fascinating journey and was
OL,18, someone I wanted to spend time with    
OL,19, too, just being witness to their chats 
OL,20, was wonderful.

OL,6, The programme continued by exploring   
OL,7, the locations and tales behind the     
OL,8, novel 'Perfume'.                       
OL,10, We discovered Richard's own obsession  
OL,11, with scent, adding extra context to    
OL,12, this exploration. I'd always heard of  
OL,13, this novel and now, with such          
OL,14, beautifully illustrated background, I  
OL,15, need to ensure I read it!              
OL,17, Alex Polizzi: My Hotel Nightmare was a 
OL,18, new addition and a great idea - after  
OL,19, years of giving others advice on their 
OL,20, own challenges, Alex turned things     
OL,21, around to focus on herself.

OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G6/6
OL,6, The premise was her joint investment,  
OL,7, with her mother Olga, in a coaching inn
OL,8, hotel in East Sussex. Bought for two   
OL,9, million pounds, it was going to need   
OL,10, the same again invested in renovations.
OL,12, We saw ever escalating costs, the      
OL,13, impact of the pandemic and tense       
OL,14, interactions with staff!               
OL,16, I loved seeing Olga in this programme  
OL,17, and the mother-daughter relationship on
OL,18, display. Alex may be bossy, but Olga is
OL,19, very much in charge here, make no      
OL,20, mistake!
