OL,10, A bit of a retro week, dear readers, in
OL,11, Sparky's world! Which, after all, is   
OL,12, tradition...                           
OL,14, Albert Square beckoned me, and I       
OL,15, enjoyed a binge watch catch up of      
OL,16, episodes currently showing on Drama,   
OL,17, from 2002.

OL,6, ....well, moany and annoying Lisa      
OL,7, Fowler? And Ian and Laura's            
OL,8, rollercoaster marriage, which in these 
OL,9, episodes sees the wife transformed into
OL,10, some sort of violent and plotting      
OL,11, temptress!                             
OL,13, There's also plenty of Dot and Jim     
OL,14, Branning action - oh I say! And        
OL,15, potentially one of the funniest periods
OL,16, of the serial too. This was the        
OL,17, evolution of Sonia Jackson, from       
OL,18, schoolgirl to grown adult character.   
OL,20, The producers clearly saw Natalie      
OL,21, Cassidy as a talent.

OL,6, One to be given juicier storylines! I'm
OL,7, not as convinced myself, she just      
OL,8, cracks me up!                          
OL,10, I continue to sail my way through the  
OL,11, waters of Howards Way - and now we're  
OL,12, on series 3 into 4! This kind of soapy 
OL,13, escapism is surely what we need these  
OL,14, days, to get away from all of the      
OL,15, nightmare headlines?!                  
OL,17, Running from 1985 to 1990, it was very 
OL,18, much of its time, but had sea legs to  
OL,19, last longer, or be ripe for a comeback!
OL,20, The Dynasty of the south coast!

OL,8, marriage, with one of Rene's waitresses
OL,9, from Allo Allo, sacre bleu!

OL,12, transported from a 1950s received

OL,16, And Charles Frere battles with his     
OL,17, father Sir Edward, schmoozing around   
OL,18, town, his fake tan becoming            
OL,19, progressively darker!                  
OL,21, It's an interesting mix, for sure.

OL,6, In part, some characters like Jack     
OL,7, Rolfe are totally down to Earth and    
OL,8, pretty gritty - but as time goes on,   
OL,9, these are far more infrequent compared 
OL,10, to fabulously wealthy figures like     
OL,11, Frere. I love it!                      
OL,13, Which brings me to the rest of Drama's 
OL,14, output! The channel is a real gem, home
OL,15, of some golden reruns of classics like 
OL,16, the aforementioned.                    
OL,18, Also, you can find quality shows again,
OL,19, such as Inspector George Gently, Judge 
OL,20, John Deed, Dalziel and Pascoe, nightly 
OL,21, New Tricks - and much, much more.

OL,6, The future of British television needs 
OL,7, this, especially in these days of      
OL,8, streaming - new audiences will need    
OL,9, reminding of the top notch programming 
OL,10, that we have always produced in this   
OL,11, country!                               
OL,13, And they are ready for that, with      
OL,14, streaming of all these delights        
OL,15, available on UKTV Play's catch up      
OL,16, service. I wonder how this may evolve, 
OL,17, and with BBC4 rapidly becoming repeats 
OL,18, central, how long will Drama be allowed
OL,19, access to so many BBC shows, before    
OL,20, they are taken away for the            
OL,21, corporation's own classics service?
