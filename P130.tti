OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G1/6
OL,6, This week's telly: Lady Boss: The      
OL,7, Jackie Collins Story (BBC2);The Real   
OL,8, Marigold on Tour (BBC4); Timothy Spall 
OL,9, Back at Sea (BBC4)                     
OL,11, It's all about the Beeb this week,     
OL,12, beginning with the glossy and glam Lady
OL,13, Boss: The Jackie Collins Story on BBC2.
OL,14, Quite a hefty hour and a half for what 
OL,15, some may consider a lightweight        
OL,16, subject.                               
OL,18, However, give her a chance and there's 
OL,19, a lot more to Jackie Collins than meets
OL,20, the eye. She was so talented - it may  
OL,21, not be your cup of tea, that's all.

OL,6, Like any story of a rise to fame, you  
OL,7, have to take it with a pinch of salt   
OL,8, when we are told that she wrote at red 
OL,9, lights as she drove the kids to school 
OL,10, - come on!                             
OL,12, Her novels were ground breaking though,
OL,13, that's the truth, and she did work damn
OL,14, hard for that success! And success it  
OL,15, was, an astronomical rise to the top, a
OL,16, novelist becoming a true celebrity.    
OL,18, Her own life was pretty colourful too, 
OL,19, laced with real sadness, right up to   
OL,20, her own secretive cancer diagnosis that
OL,21, ended her life.

OL,6, Almost as though the most dramatic     
OL,7, story of all was her own - soundbites  
OL,8, from many, including sister Joan of    
OL,9, course, reveal more substance. The     
OL,10, Collins are a loving and close knit    
OL,11, family. There's real heart, under the  
OL,12, glitz and sparkle.                     
OL,14, Slightly less glam was The Real        
OL,15, Marigold on Tour - a very welcome      
OL,16, repeat showing for this celeb retiree  
OL,17, tour of Iceland.                       
OL,19, I absolutely adore these series, each  
OL,20, one showing us new facets to the senior
OL,21, citizen stars.

OL,6, Watching them try out retirement       
OL,7, lifestyles in other nations, exploring 
OL,8, how those people treat their           
OL,9, pensioners, is a fascinating eye opener
OL,10, - touching as well as often hilarious! 
OL,12, When it comes to hilarious, the one who
OL,13, gets me right in the funny bone is     
OL,14, Rustie Lee - the bubbly Brummie only   
OL,15, has to start her booming and raucous   
OL,16, laughter for me to be chuckling away   
OL,17, too!! The sight of her giggling her way
OL,18, into a natural spa pool and partaking  
OL,19, in morning exercise routines is pure   
OL,20, joy.

OL,6, As was Sheila Ferguson's dating        
OL,7, exploits with a charming Icelandic     
OL,8, chap, being remarkably candid about her
OL,9, feelings on romance and companionship -
OL,10, pulling at the heart strings of many   
OL,11, viewers I'm sure.                      
OL,13, It's a lovely programme, please can we 
OL,14, have more? Am hoping the BBC will      
OL,15, commission more, even in these times of
OL,16, unsure budgets and frozen licence fees.
OL,18, In a world where pensioners are often  
OL,19, invisible, series like this highlight  
OL,20, how relevant they still are, how much  
OL,21, we learn from our seniors.

OL,6, We owe them!                           
OL,8, Finally, also on BBC4, is a reshowing  
OL,9, of Timothy Spall Back at Sea. This is  
OL,10, the kind of show we will lose, if BBC4 
OL,11, is closed down. And we cannot have     
OL,12, that.                                  
OL,14, A simple concept, follow Tim and his   
OL,15, wife as they go boating, navigating    
OL,16, their way through several adventures - 
OL,17, and it works, through their            
OL,18, personalities, through what it teaches 
OL,19, us about their passion for the seas.   
OL,20, They are so engaging, I could watch so 
OL,21, much more - simple pleasures in viewing
