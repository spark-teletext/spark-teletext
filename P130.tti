OL,6, This week's telly: Write Around The    
OL,7, World with Richard E Grant - BBC4;     
OL,8, Saturday Kitchen - BBC2; Good Morning  
OL,9, Britain - ITV                          
OL,11, A week whizzed by and one highlight    
OL,12, this time around was a programme I was 
OL,13, so looking forward to!                 
OL,15, Write Around The World is made for me -
OL,16, I love Richard E Grant and everything  
OL,17, he does! Ever since Withnail & I,      
OL,18, through to his luxury hotel shows for  
OL,19, Sky and recent Oscar nominated success 
OL,20, in 'Can You Ever Forgive Me', he has   
OL,21, the perfect level of charisma for this.

OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G2/6
OL,6, The first in a three part series,      
OL,7, exploring the locations of classic     
OL,8, novels and key author moments through  
OL,9, history.                               
OL,11, As I love writing myself and devour as 
OL,12, many novels as time allows, I was keen 
OL,13, to tune into the first episode.        
OL,15, Location Italy - a stunningly beautiful
OL,16, country and I lapped up his tour, the  
OL,17, people he met and a highlight was the  
OL,18, place where 'The Talented Mr Ripley'   
OL,19, was set - it took me right back there  
OL,20, and I cannot wait for the next episode 
OL,21, in this delightful flight of fancy.

OL,6, Saturday Kitchen, on the very morning I
OL,7, write this, has transferred to BBC2    
OL,8, temporarily whilst the Olympics are    
OL,9, running.                               
OL,11, A staple to start the weekend, this    
OL,12, week was a corker of a show. Fun filled
OL,13, guest in the form of comedian Ellie    
OL,14, Taylor, showing us her piping bag      
OL,15, skills in a choux pastry demo!         
OL,17, I also love the carousel of cooks on   
OL,18, display each week, every time bringing 
OL,19, culinary surprises that I'm enthralled 
OL,20, by - something to devour with your eyes
OL,21, as an early weekend treat.

OL,6, Matt Tebbutt was a host I have to admit
OL,7, I really did not take to at first. He's
OL,8, grown on me though and now I feel he is
OL,9, perfect for the show. A slightly       
OL,10, anarchic feel to proceedings, getting  
OL,11, smoke in his eyes this morning! He also
OL,12, engages so well with guests - they are 
OL,13, all clearly having so much fun..and    
OL,14, what could be better than that?!       
OL,16, If you haven't partaken so far, give it
OL,17, a whirl! Even if the studio antics     
OL,18, aren't so much for you, a great idea is
OL,19, the way we are given short programmes  
OL,20, within a programme - from the likes of 
OL,21, Keith Floyd, Mary Berry, Nigella...

OL,6, Something to tempt every taste!        
OL,8, Speaking of not to every taste, Good   
OL,9, Morning Britain has caught my eye      
OL,10, lately too!                            
OL,12, I'm normally a BBC Breakfast fan and,  
OL,13, since it temporarily became Olympic    
OL,14, Breakfast, I've still been tuning in   
OL,15, and enjoying that coverage - with a few
OL,16, exceptions.                            
OL,18, If the sport of the morning hasn't held
OL,19, my interest, I've strayed over to the  
OL,20, dark side. Since the departure of Piers
OL,21, Morgan, it's more tempting!

OL,6, Ben Shepherd and Kate Garraway are a   
OL,7, pairing I could definitely warm to - an
OL,8, easy style that is a comforting way to 
OL,9, start your day. Also, Sean Fletcher and
OL,10, Ranvir Singh impressed me - an         
OL,11, overarching impression was one of      
OL,12, professional, knowledge and also a     
OL,13, healthy dose of humour!                
OL,15, BBC Breakfast has the same, but as the 
OL,16, saying goes - a change is as good as a 
OL,17, rest!                                  
OL,19, Dare I say it? I may return to Good    
OL,20, Morning Britain again....sometimes,    
OL,21, let's not get too carried away!
