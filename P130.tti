OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G2/6
OL,6, I noticed this new drama was from Ryan 
OL,7, Murphy Productions. I can honestly say 
OL,8, that I have loved most of what has come
OL,9, out of his creative mind - from        
OL,10, Nip/Tuck, to Feud, to American Crime   
OL,11, Story, to American Horror Story and    
OL,12, much more!                             
OL,14, Would this be treated with the         
OL,15, heavyweight gravitas you may expect, or
OL,16, have some of the Murphy glitz and camp 
OL,17, touches about it also?!                
OL,19, If episode one is any indication, it's 
OL,20, going to be former! This is gruelling, 
OL,21, heavy, dark, and quite an ordeal.

OL,6, Brace yourself for quite a difficult   
OL,7, watch.                                 
OL,9, The tone seems perfect, it's dirty and 
OL,10, grimy, and Evan Peters is perfectly    
OL,11, cast as Dahmer - he can scare the      
OL,12, bejesus out of any of us, if he has a  
OL,13, mind to! I know I am going to be       
OL,14, gripped from now onwards...            
OL,16, Industry has returned! This isn't dirty
OL,17, and grimy, yet I still feel like I need
OL,18, a wash after watching it. The          
OL,19, characters are repugnant, and yes also 
OL,20, filth bags. Rutting like animals, as   
OL,21, they claw their way.

OL,6, The sewer rats of investment banking,  
OL,7, in designer suits!                     
OL,9, I talk as if I don't enjoy it, I kind  
OL,10, of love it. I recommended it to many   
OL,11, friends, during the first series - only
OL,12, one saw it, and also became a fan. It's
OL,13, a rare gem, if you know, you know!     
OL,15, Which is why I never really believed   
OL,16, that it would be back for a second     
OL,17, series. Yet, here it is, that brilliant
OL,18, electronic soundtrack buzzing again,   
OL,19, the cast of crackling and cracking hot 
OL,20, young things.

OL,6, It's relentless, some of the lines will
OL,7, have you roaring - both intentionally  
OL,8, and otherwise - and you'll likely feel 
OL,9, exhausted and satisfied by the         
OL,10, end...much like the characters.        
OL,12, Quite the opposite of this rich high   
OL,13, life is the Channel 5 documentary 1978:
OL,14, Winter of Discontent.                  
OL,16, Obviously churned out to remind us     
OL,17, Brits of the last time the country was 
OL,18, in a state anything the present. We    
OL,19, have our energy crisis, cost of living 
OL,20, challenges.

OL,6, In 1978, the UK was in the grip of so  
OL,7, many economic and social challenges,   
OL,8, it's horrifying to look back on.       
OL,10, Strikes left, right and centre in      
OL,11, public services - closed schools,      
OL,12, skeleton staff in hospitals, rubbish   
OL,13, piling up in the streets, a four day   
OL,14, week introduced.                       
OL,16, As if that wasn't bad enough, the      
OL,17, country was covered in deep snow, with 
OL,18, temperatures below freezing for days on
OL,19, end. Even with what the news tells us  
OL,20, these days, things were much worse back
OL,21, then - let's hope it's all behind us.
