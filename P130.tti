OL,6, This week's telly: My Family, Partition
OL,7, and Me: India 1947 (BBC4); The Big     
OL,8, Breakfast (Channel 4); The Princess    
OL,9, (Sky Documentaries)                    
OL,11, Anita Rani is a presenter I always warm
OL,12, to, and this was a welcome showing of  
OL,13, My Family, Partition and Me by BBC4    
OL,14, (we'll be seeing a lot more of these   
OL,15, welcome repeats from the channel!).    
OL,17, Part of a season of programmes about   
OL,18, Partition, it's fascinating to hear    
OL,19, about such family histories as hers,   
OL,20, tying in with incredible sadness and   
OL,21, violence about some events.

OL,6, It was a violent and troubled beginning
OL,7, for the nation of Pakistan, some tales 
OL,8, truly horrifying.                      
OL,10, One such story, a family doctor local  
OL,11, to the area Anita's family lived in -  
OL,12, he was Muslim, and was convinced that  
OL,13, Partition would mean his area of the   
OL,14, Punjab would be part of the new nation.
OL,15, It wasn't, the new border being placed 
OL,16, differently to expectations.           
OL,18, Overnight, people who loved him wanted 
OL,19, him dead, he was instantly written off 
OL,20, due to his beliefs! He fled in the dead
OL,21, of night, to the new Pakistan.

OL,6, It wasn't something I could not        
OL,7, comprehend at all, and yet was just one
OL,8, of so many episodes like this.         
OL,10, It's wise to absorb as many of these   
OL,11, programmes as possible, such is the    
OL,12, importance of this history - we all    
OL,13, need to know, that much is for sure.   
OL,15, I was a huge fan of the original The   
OL,16, Big Breakfast, right from day one in   
OL,17, 1992 - waking up with Chris Evans and  
OL,18, Gaby Roslin each day.                  
OL,20, For years it entertained in a bold and 
OL,21, brash way, so fresh and new.

OL,6, Nothing of it's ilk had ever been seen 
OL,7, on television before, and it helped    
OL,8, break down new barriers.               
OL,10, Now, Channel 4 are reimagining it, as a
OL,11, Saturday morning show - with the       
OL,12, fizzing Mo Gilligan and AJ Odudu at the
OL,13, helm!                                  
OL,15, They did a cracking job actually, and  
OL,16, it may never recapture what it once    
OL,17, was, and nor should it - the landscape 
OL,18, has changed now. Getting Denise Van    
OL,19, Outen, one time presenter, as a guest  
OL,20, was a masterstroke - the familiar      
OL,21, easing in the new!

OL,6, Whether it will stay the distance is   
OL,7, another matter - and I feel a bit      
OL,8, disappointed that they haven't brought 
OL,9, it back across the week.               
OL,11, Whilst we don't necessarily need       
OL,12, another breakfast show, I'm a bit tired
OL,13, of seeing Channel 4 offer nothing      
OL,14, better than US sitcoms repeats - time  
OL,15, for a comeback, to capture that yoof   
OL,16, audience that once loved it!           
OL,18, However, maybe Saturday morning is the 
OL,19, best way, and the right way, to do     
OL,20, this. Perhaps it's best done right on  
OL,21, one bubbly batch, once a week.

OL,6, Anything more may dilute it, and kill  
OL,7, it for a second time!                  
OL,9, As I write, I am watching The Princess,
OL,10, a new documentary about Diana, Princess
OL,11, of Wales.                              
OL,13, It's really engaging, and is relying   
OL,14, strictly on archive footage - none of  
OL,15, those annoying talking heads that are  
OL,16, just everywhere on documentaries now.  
OL,18, This lets the subject speak for        
OL,19, herself, bringing forth footage that we
OL,20, haven't actually seen before too. Just 
OL,21, when you thought there was nothing new!
