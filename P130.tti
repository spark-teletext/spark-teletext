OL,6, This week's telly: The Great British   
OL,7, Bake Off - Channel 4; Coronation Street
OL,8, - ITV; Succession - Sky Box Sets       
OL,10, I've had a very eclectic week's viewing
OL,11, this time around. I realise that my    
OL,12, tastes vary so much, from trash telly  
OL,13, to very highbrow moments - handy for a 
OL,14, telly critic of course!                
OL,16, In addition to my regular comfort      
OL,17, viewing of The Golden Girls on Disney  
OL,18, Plus, another show that is the         
OL,19, televisual equivalent of a warm blanket
OL,20, is The Great British Bake Off!

OL,6, Biscuit week this time and of course   
OL,7, there was the usual display of last    
OL,8, minute panics, resulting in total      
OL,9, messes! This series has some stand out 
OL,10, characters - German Jurgen is going to 
OL,11, go far and is winning Star Baker twice 
OL,12, already, with his precision and skill! 
OL,14, Plus Prue-a-like, whatsherface! Anyway,
OL,15, for me, I get maximum pleasure from the
OL,16, presenters! I definitely have a        
OL,17, love/hate thing for Paul Hollywood,    
OL,18, whereas it's pure love for Prue!       
OL,20, It's hard to quantify, but her         
OL,21, authority, manner that puts all at ease

OL,6, - and amazing array of specs! They all 
OL,7, contribute to her towering presence!   
OL,9, Plus Matt and Noel, love them! Noel has
OL,10, stood out more previously, but I feel  
OL,11, Matt is being allowed to shine more    
OL,12, these days - both of them interact with
OL,13, the contestants brilliantly - oh it's a
OL,14, warmer, as the weather cools!          
OL,16, After being completely hooked on the   
OL,17, classic episodes on ITV3, I've turned  
OL,18, some attention to the current Corrie - 
OL,19, hoping it would be improving.          
OL,21, There are signs of that, to be fair.

OL,6, Strong characters like Toyah and Imran 
OL,7, have been impressive of late, plus Nina
OL,8, proves that the young ones can hold    
OL,9, their own.                             
OL,11, Trouble is, I think Corrie is confusing
OL,12, the humour of days gone by with        
OL,13, downright daft scripts and storylines  
OL,14, for some characters.                   
OL,16, Take Gail and Audrey - never           
OL,17, Shakespearian types admittedly, but    
OL,18, they were far more serious than now -  
OL,19, moments punctuated by humour. Whereas  
OL,20, now, you're hard pressed to see them   
OL,21, have a serious moment!

OL,6, Acting like a pair of loons, it's just 
OL,7, becoming irritating!                   
OL,9, Is it the current storyliners? Or      
OL,10, scriptwriters? Either way, something   
OL,11, needs to alter please!                 
OL,13, One of the finest shows to ever grace  
OL,14, our screens has been Succession, and   
OL,15, with the third series due later this   
OL,16, month it's time for a rewatch of the   
OL,17, previous episodes.                     
OL,19, If you haven't enjoyed this tale of the
OL,20, media mogul Logan Roy's tussling with  
OL,21, his children, now is your chance!

OL,6, Showrunner Jesse Armstrong was         
OL,7, responsible for Peep Show, and that wit
OL,8, is apparent throughout.                
OL,10, The drama has a cast of detestable     
OL,11, characters - you'll love to hate them! 
OL,12, Such a dysfunctional family...but it is
OL,13, brilliant!                             
OL,15, My favourite has to be the patriarch   
OL,16, himself, Logan, played so brilliantly  
OL,17, by Brian Cox! Most scenes are full of  
OL,18, his angry expletives and you're left   
OL,19, reeling after some of his snapping     
OL,20, retorts. Go seek it out - and enjoy!
