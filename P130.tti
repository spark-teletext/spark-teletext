OL,6, This series has been something special 
OL,7, though, I can highly recommend catching
OL,8, up on iplayer if you missed it!        
OL,10, It's strange looking back on those     
OL,11, Games, with the overwhelming and       
OL,12, genuine sense of national pride they   
OL,13, instilled across the UK. It was real, I
OL,14, remember it very well - it was a       
OL,15, showcase and a sporting success for    
OL,16, Team GB to be so proud of.             
OL,18, Looking back on this is what we all    
OL,19, need, restore some of that faith in the
OL,20, nation - which let's face it, has been 
OL,21, hard to muster in recent times

OL,6, (Euro 2020 excepted).                  
OL,8, During the revisit to 'Super Saturday' 
OL,9, and the multiple successes of that day,
OL,10, the excitement even now is incredible! 
OL,11, Each event relived, the crowds huge and
OL,12, supportive!                            
OL,14, With this, and the following           
OL,15, testimonies of how successful the      
OL,16, Paralympics were too - I definitely had
OL,17, something in my eye several times      
OL,18, during this programme!

OL,6, No matter how many times I see it, I   
OL,7, always want to again! Following a      
OL,8, recent showing on Gold, the classic    
OL,9, sitcom is back on BBC4.                
OL,11, This episode, like any, has key stand  
OL,12, out moments. Remember Margo forcing Tom
OL,13, and Barbara to get shot of their pigs -
OL,14, and then save them? Also, the rocket   
OL,15, fuel impact of their peapod homebrew   
OL,16, vino? Still hilarious and it's a       
OL,17, guaranteed pick me up in this          
OL,18, household!                             
OL,20, I wonder if they felt, when recording, 
OL,21, that they were part of a classic.

OL,6, Another comedy classic was anything    
OL,7, involving Les Dawson - when scanning   
OL,8, the listings, I thought this week's    
OL,9, documentary was a repeat - quickly     
OL,10, realising that it was new show.        
OL,12, It was wonderful viewing - interviews  
OL,13, with his widow and daughter (he died   
OL,14, when she was a baby). I still can't    
OL,15, quite get over the fact that his       
OL,16, daughter is a reality telly 'star' and 
OL,17, that behind the glossy and superficial 
OL,18, exterior is a personality like her     
OL,19, father's. As she said, 'I'm basically  
OL,20, him, in drag!'

OL,6, As the title suggests, he left a       
OL,7, treasure trove of recordings that were 
OL,8, shared here. Including his first stand 
OL,9, up jokes and the early days, diaries   
OL,10, containing moving moments about his    
OL,11, early struggles, home movies of first  
OL,12, wife Meg and her final days of illness 
OL,13, - and even a vinyl recording of Les    
OL,14, singing opera! He was a fantastic      
OL,15, singer and pianist (you have to be to  
OL,16, be convincingly out of tune as a joke).
OL,18, There were other fine contributions    
OL,19, from the likes of Jason Manford and    
OL,20, reminiscing about key moments.

OL,6, It's tragic that his life was cut short
OL,7, in his fifties - it would be for anyone
OL,8, of course - with Les, a great career   
OL,9, that could have run for many more years
OL,10, was ceased.                            
OL,12, Show me a Cissie and Ada sketch and it 
OL,13, will never fail to crack me up so much 
OL,14, - he was a comedian I only had to look 
OL,15, at in order to laugh, and that is a    
OL,16, gift he gave to many in his short time 
OL,17, with us. It's even more touching that  
OL,18, he didn't get his break until the age  
OL,19, of 38 - I guess it's true that         
OL,20, sometimes the brightest of flames burn 
OL,21, quickly...
