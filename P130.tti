OL,6, Our Carol is onto a good thing here, am
OL,7, not sure I have ever seen such an easy 
OL,8, win of a programme.                    
OL,10, We saw Carol wandering around the      
OL,11, market, buying some lovely things and  
OL,12, chit chatting in French (considering   
OL,13, she's lived there thirty five years, I 
OL,14, was surprised by the style - I think my
OL,15, GCSE makes my French sound more        
OL,16, convincing).                           
OL,18, We saw Carol gasping and goshing with  
OL,19, her husband Michel, horrified at the   
OL,20, table he'd bought in a junk sale. It   
OL,21, was at times unbearably twee!

OL,6, I couldn't help myself though, I loved 
OL,7, it! Carol and Michel were such likeable
OL,8, people and it was a warm and comforting
OL,9, style of programme.                    
OL,11, Her history is genuinely fascinating,  
OL,12, from actress, to writer, to olive      
OL,13, farmer. What a life, it was like a warm
OL,14, hug of a travelogue.                   
OL,16, Blair & Brown: The New Labour          
OL,17, Revolution is two episodes in and      
OL,18, already a gripping documentary series! 
OL,19, It's rather scary how long ago it all  
OL,20, was now - and how, for me, a lot of it 
OL,21, only feels like yesterday.

OL,6, Such an air of optimism, a landslide   
OL,7, victory and a breath of fresh air for  
OL,8, the country.                           
OL,10, Only just into his premiership, Blair  
OL,11, was dealing with the death of the      
OL,12, Princess of Wales - that memory is     
OL,13, still very clear, watching him on TV on
OL,14, that shocking and unbelievably surreal 
OL,15, morning.                               
OL,17, Clearly, as the series progresses, we  
OL,18, will see much more challenging times   
OL,19, ahead - it's fascinating, reminding me 
OL,20, of many facets and nuances of that     
OL,21, period that had faded over time for me.

OL,6, Who Do You Think You Are is back for   
OL,7, the umpteenth series and I entered it  
OL,8, with trepidation.                      
OL,10, The series has managed to maintain     
OL,11, quality for a long time now and I      
OL,12, always wonder when that standard may   
OL,13, begin to wane.                         
OL,15, Not in this episode, clearly! Josh     
OL,16, Widdecombe was the subject - like the  
OL,17, guy, seen his live stand up show and he
OL,18, always amuses me on panel shows etc.   
OL,20, I wish I could tell you all the        
OL,21, details, but... if you haven't seen it!

OL,6, Suffice to say, this edition is a doozy
OL,7, - and what he finds out about his      
OL,8, family tree is quite mind-blowing.     
OL,10, The best part about it too are his     
OL,11, reactions. With each new revelation,   
OL,12, his laugh gets heartier and he jokes   
OL,13, and joshes more and more with the      
OL,14, historian experts.                     
OL,16, It put me in mind of that infamous     
OL,17, Danny Dyer edition, if you're a fan of 
OL,18, the show you'll know what I mean!      
OL,20, The programme, each guest a new family 
OL,21, tree, clearly has plenty of life yet!
