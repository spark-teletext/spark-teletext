OL,6, Who changed the decade and therefore   
OL,7, changed the whole music scene forever? 
OL,8, This episode presented some fantastic  
OL,9, clips of artists with huge talent and  
OL,10, stature.                               
OL,12, Glossy videos, exotic locations,       
OL,13, artists who hit the heights of pop     
OL,14, glory!                                 
OL,16, We were treated to David Bowie's Let's 
OL,17, Dance - his most successful album - and
OL,18, his transformation into suit wearing   
OL,19, megastar, filling stadiums and working 
OL,20, with the magic touch of Nile Rodgers.

OL,6, Enter Tina Turner, her Eighties        
OL,7, comeback one of the most successful of 
OL,8, all time! I breathed it all in, the    
OL,9, rare clips, the facts, the insightful  
OL,10, commentary. A quality programme to     
OL,11, satisfy all lovers of the decade of    
OL,12, excess!                                
OL,14, I almost missed UFO! Stumbled across it
OL,15, on catch up telly, this four part Sky  
OL,16, Documentaries series was enthralling!  
OL,18, I've always been fascinated by an alien
OL,19, doc, this did not disappoint - probably
OL,20, because it was produced by JJ Abrams   
OL,21, and he knows what will grab you.

OL,6, Some thrilling footage of UFO          
OL,7, sightings, many of which I had never   
OL,8, seen before.                           
OL,10, Episodes focused in turn on first      
OL,11, contact, Navy pilot sightings, cover   
OL,12, ups and alien abductions.              
OL,14, The interviews and the evidence        
OL,15, presented leave it hard to be unmoved -
OL,16, and hard to dispute what's being said. 
OL,17, Are they already here regularly? Will  
OL,18, we ever know?                          
OL,20, Whatever happens in my lifetime, I'm   
OL,21, sure it will change one day.

OL,6, It made me feel that we're already     
OL,7, being visited regularly...and maybe our
OL,8, governments already know, it's         
OL,9, remarkable that it's not come out by   
OL,10, now....we shall see!                   
OL,12, Is the true sign of a telly addict (or 
OL,13, sad man) someone who records a daytime 
OL,14, telly programme and watches it during  
OL,15, the evening?                           
OL,17, If so, that's me! Morning Live is on at
OL,18, 9.15am each day - but I tend to watch  
OL,19, it about 7pm! It's a comforting        
OL,20, blanket, an hour of cosy after BBC     
OL,21, Breakfast.

OL,6, Many programmes talk about being 'a    
OL,7, family' and it's a load of tosh, but I 
OL,8, do feel this team are like siblings.   
OL,10, True professionals too - even in the   
OL,11, absence of Gethin and Kym, we have Ravi
OL,12, and Kimberley, Dr Xand, Rupi, Dr Punam 
OL,13, et al - welcome additions to my screen.
OL,14, Lifestyle and consumer slices of life  
OL,15, that educate, inform and entertain.    
OL,17, They arrived during lockdown and have  
OL,18, stayed - long may this continue,       
OL,19, because if it's comforting for me, it  
OL,20, must be a lifeline for many more       
OL,21, vulnerable and craving such delights.
