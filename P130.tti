OL,6, We love to hate them and the plot      
OL,7, weaves its way so cleverly!            
OL,9, The script is incredibly clever, there 
OL,10, are genius lines that stay with you -  
OL,11, it's going to be a forever quotable    
OL,12, drama.                                 
OL,14, The final episode brought with it some 
OL,15, machinations and twists and turns that 
OL,16, left me open mouthed, it was gripping  
OL,17, telly and I instantly need to rewatch  
OL,18, the entire series, for it's the type of
OL,19, show that you'll get even more from    
OL,20, during multiple viewings.

OL,6, Yellowjackets was recommended to me,   
OL,7, the tale of a female high school soccer
OL,8, team - a tale of survival after they're
OL,9, involved in a plane crash in Ontario.  
OL,11, I've only got through episode one so   
OL,12, far, which was of course filled with   
OL,13, the feeling of dread for what was to   
OL,14, come, plus the usual character type set
OL,15, ups.                                   
OL,17, There were also flash forwards, post   
OL,18, plane crash, which filled the viewer   
OL,19, with intrigue. However, I felt as      
OL,20, though I was left cold after this..it  
OL,21, didn't grip me.

OL,6, I even felt quite cynical about it,    
OL,7, maybe due to a concept that has        
OL,8, probably been visited more than we     
OL,9, recall (Lost and the like)...maybe I'll
OL,10, stick with it though!                  
OL,12, This week's Graham Norton Show was a   
OL,13, corker of a week, the final show before
OL,14, Christmas! Romesh Ranganathan, Stanley 
OL,15, Tucci, Jamie Oliver and Dame Joan      
OL,16, Collins were this week's guests.       
OL,18, Stanley Tucci has always been a great  
OL,19, value guest, I fine actor and also     
OL,20, really interesting personality with    
OL,21, much more to him that his performances.

OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G5/6
OL,6, He's brought out a book (of course,    
OL,7, they all do), about culinary           
OL,8, experiences, an extra string to his    
OL,9, bow.                                   
OL,11, Stepping on Jamie Oliver's toes with   
OL,12, the food there, who was there to push  
OL,13, his family recipe book launch! I'll    
OL,14, gloss over his appearance, not a fave  
OL,15, in this household!                     
OL,17, Romesh was brilliant, great fun and    
OL,18, promoting his hosting of The Weakest   
OL,19, Link's return (why him, not sure on    
OL,20, that). And finally, one of the finest  
OL,21, chat show guests - Joan Collins!

OL,6, The woman is incredible, so vital and  
OL,7, looking great, still showing that spark
OL,8, of personality and wit.                
OL,10, Her promo slot was for a New Year telly
OL,11, show, looking back at her career -     
OL,12, expect a review soon! I don't mind this
OL,13, rampant promotion on Graham's show,    
OL,14, because the guests are fascinating and 
OL,15, deserve success.
