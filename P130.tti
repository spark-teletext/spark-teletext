OL,6, Sparky's Festive and New Year telly    
OL,7, review!                                
OL,9, Happy New Year telly addicts! I do hope
OL,10, you had a marvellous Yule and great    
OL,11, start to 2022!                         
OL,12, So what televisual treats did we feast 
OL,13, on, in between turkey and pudding?     
OL,15, Personally, I do like a traditional    
OL,16, viewing, part of that being Carol's    
OL,17, From Kings - it really gets me in the  
OL,18, festive mood every time!               
OL,20, Christmas Eve warmed me up nicely, but 
OL,21, what did the day itself hold?

OL,6, Her Majesty at 3pm was an essential    
OL,7, watch this year, quite poignant, yet   
OL,8, also reminding us of just how stoic she
OL,9, is - still part of our Christmas nigh  
OL,10, on seventy years!                      
OL,12, The BBC rolled out a nice selection box
OL,13, - I caught a bit of heartwarming Mary  
OL,14, Poppins Returns, and whilst Call The   
OL,15, Midwife isn't one I have tried, am sure
OL,16, many lapped it up!                     
OL,18, Over at BBC2 that evening, Ron Howard's
OL,19, 2019 documentary film Pavarotti was a  
OL,20, joy! I'd not known much about the great
OL,21, man, and by the end of it was a fan!

OL,6, Larger than life, his personality      
OL,7, magnetic and his love of life and those
OL,8, around him was a delight. This was     
OL,9, followed by a showing of his 1991 Hyde 
OL,10, Park concert - incredible!             
OL,12, ITV? Not such a rich treat - soap      
OL,13, specials are standard, but I'm no fan  
OL,14, of The Larkins and as for showing Santa
OL,15, Claus The Movie in a key slot? I enjoy 
OL,16, that film, but come on ITV, you can do 
OL,17, better!                                
OL,19, In fact, it was an easy win for the    
OL,20, Beeb, I'd say!

OL,6, How about New Year? In these days of   
OL,7, streaming and catch up rescheduling,   
OL,8, I'm not sure anyone is trying too hard.
OL,9, Much the same on ITV, with rolling out 
OL,10, showings of Spectre there, Indiana     
OL,11, Jones on Channel 4 and When Harry Met  
OL,12, Sally on Channel 5!                    
OL,14, Who would save our evening's viewing?! 
OL,15, Jools Holland of course! The Hootenanny
OL,16, is a staple, this year being joined by 
OL,17, Gregory Porter, Lulu (sing shout,      
OL,18, anyone?), Rag 'n' Bone man and Yola!   
OL,19, Always a quality gathering!            
OL,21, BBC1 surprised me, decent line up!

OL,6, The Graham Norton Show was an          
OL,7, entertaining mix - Jessica Chastain,   
OL,8, Peter Dinklage and Joe                 
OL,9, Lycett...followed by The Big New Years 
OL,10, & Years Eve Party. Geddit?             
OL,12, No, many wouldn't, but it refers to    
OL,13, Olly 'Years & Years' Alexander         
OL,14, performing his hits and duetting with  
OL,15, the likes of Kylie Minogue. I watched  
OL,16, this in the run up to cheering on Big  
OL,17, Ben and the fireworks with friends, and
OL,18, it was an enjoyable romp through to    
OL,19, year end!                              
OL,21, How about your seasonal viewing?

OL,6, Did it match up to expectations! I     
OL,7, think we sometimes imagine it to match 
OL,8, our childhood memories, which it will  
OL,9, never live up to.                      
OL,11, And yes, some channels are lazy, not   
OL,12, even really bothering now. Yet, the BBC
OL,13, still stands strong and sees it as     
OL,14, 'event television' - which I strongly  
OL,15, agree with!                            
OL,17, We don't have to be glued to it        
OL,18, throughout, but it can provide         
OL,19, entertainment for your family time -   
OL,20, and for some people alone, it IS their 
OL,21, company and a warming lifeline.
