OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G1/6
OL,6, This week's telly: TalkTV launch       
OL,8, It's not very often that a new channel 
OL,9, launch worth talking about comes along 
OL,10, - one with a huge marketing push, some 
OL,11, big name signings, something to get    
OL,12, people talking!                        
OL,14, There's no denying that TalkTV is a    
OL,15, launch worth flagging, so my review    
OL,16, this week is purely focused on that.   
OL,18, Murdoch's News UK are the owners, not a
OL,19, company I am always a huge fan of, but 
OL,20, there is no denying they know how to   
OL,21, create a buzz!

OL,6, With the budget behind it, they've     
OL,7, certainly achieved an aim of showing up
OL,8, GB News!                               
OL,10, Whilst GB News is steadily finding its 
OL,11, feet and building a loyal fan base, the
OL,12, Talk TV launch of course had the       
OL,13, backing of the other News UK           
OL,14, stablemates The Sun, The Times and     
OL,15, more.                                  
OL,17, GB News simulcast on DAB radio, and    
OL,18, TalkTV during the day and other off    
OL,19, peaks hours is a simulcast of TalkRadio
OL,20, - a pretty darn good idea I thought,   
OL,21, taking something already established.

OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G3/6
OL,6, This has been polished up, a new fancy 
OL,7, studio in the News UK building at      
OL,8, London Bridge, and getting the talent  
OL,9, on camera.                             
OL,11, As for the peak shows, much has been   
OL,12, made of Piers Morgan Uncensored, but   
OL,13, the first show - The News Desk with Tom
OL,14, Newton Dunn - was an impressive start  
OL,15, for the channel!                       
OL,17, Bold, brash, great music and graphics -
OL,18, I love the identity they have created! 
OL,19, There's no mistaking who they are!     
OL,21, Tom's a charismatic presenter for sure.

OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G4/6
OL,6, His show is a slick round up of the    
OL,7, day, with lively reporting and debate. 
OL,9, Onto that man, Piers Morgan! I'm not a 
OL,10, great fan, but its quite hypnotic      
OL,11, stuff! The first two shows included his
OL,12, interview with Trump - which, let's    
OL,13, face it, was pure comedy and two       
OL,14, ridiculous figures! Yet, I couldn't    
OL,15, stop watching, it was entertaining!    
OL,17, After Piers on weeknights, it's The    
OL,18, Talk - Sharon Osbourne's panel         
OL,19, discussion show. I was struck first by 
OL,20, Sharon's latest disturbing face lift,  
OL,21, and second by the hosting hierarchy.

OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G5/6
OL,6, It didn't seem like it actually was her
OL,7, show, Jeremy Kyle seemed to dominate to
OL,8, me! Maybe she's a bit wobbly and needs 
OL,9, to find her feet more.                 
OL,11, The panel includes complete unknowns to
OL,12, me, but I thought Vanessa Feltz was a  
OL,13, fine inclusion, she's good value! It   
OL,14, was lively and worked well, but I feel 
OL,15, it will evolve more.                   
OL,17, Beyond these shows, we move into the   
OL,18, TalkTV/Radio hybrid - the likes of     
OL,19, James Whale (listened to him on the    
OL,20, original TalkRadio incarnation!), a    
OL,21, couple of unknowns who I quite liked...

OL,6, ...and the frankly poisonous Julia     
OL,7, Hartley-Brewer at breakfast! No thank  
OL,8, you, I can do without her over my      
OL,9, cornflakes! That's where my clashing   
OL,10, politics start to interfere with my    
OL,11, viewing.                               
OL,13, Will TalkTV be a success? On first     
OL,14, impressions, I'm inclined to say yes.  
OL,15, It's got backing, it's got names, and I
OL,16, do feel that there is room for it. Are 
OL,17, we ready for a more outspoken,         
OL,18, opinionated and right wing style       
OL,19, channel? Yes, it reflects the country's
OL,20, tone - and that will determine whether 
OL,21, it also stays and builds an audience!
