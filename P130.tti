OL,6, This week's telly: Classic EastEnders  
OL,7, (Drama); Dancing On Ice (ITV1);        
OL,8, Industry (BBC1)                        
OL,10, Since Christmas and New Year telly     
OL,11, dominated, I've been on a game of catch
OL,12, up on many programmes and series. Busy 
OL,13, times mean there aren't enough hours in
OL,14, the day, and so many services to keep  
OL,15, up with.                               
OL,17, Exciting times are ahead with the      
OL,18, series in the pipeline from the        
OL,19, channels, streaming services and       
OL,20, options available now. Even ITV is     
OL,21, tempting me now with ITVX.

OL,6, I was binge watching some Classic      
OL,7, EastEnders this week, which in 2002 was
OL,8, certainly a golden era for the soap.   
OL,9, The likes of Pauline, Peggy, Pat and   
OL,10, Sharon firing on all cylinders!        
OL,12, One of said episodes included the death
OL,13, and funeral of Angie Watts. Well, death
OL,14, off screen of course, and the funeral a
OL,15, rather sorry affair, with very few     
OL,16, mourners attending, because Sharon     
OL,17, 'didn't have time' (eh?! We all know   
OL,18, it's because the actors wouldn't come  
OL,19, back haha).                            
OL,21, Although, a guest appearance was there!

OL,6, Jan, Den's former mistress, popped by  
OL,7, to wind everybody up, that was fun!    
OL,9, One thing I always hoped was that Anita
OL,10, Dobson could have come back to the show
OL,11, one day, it's a real shame that was    
OL,12, never possible, a real missed          
OL,13, opportunity for both them and her I    
OL,14, feel.                                  
OL,16, Dancing On Ice is a show I have barely 
OL,17, seen before, but I watched an episode  
OL,18, with friends on catch up, and it was   
OL,19, really good fun! Torvill and Dean are  
OL,20, amazing, when the performed - both in  
OL,21, their sixties - I was blown away.

OL,6, There has to be comedy too of course,  
OL,7, and that was John Fashanu, barely being
OL,8, able to move on the ice. I feel for    
OL,9, you, mate, that would be me!           
OL,11, I could understand why the show is so  
OL,12, popular for ITV1, it's a cut price     
OL,13, Strictly, and also takes real skill to 
OL,14, be able to impress. In fact, it must be
OL,15, harder than Strictly to master that!   
OL,16, Yet, I may not be back, I may just be  
OL,17, skating by for now!                    
OL,19, Industry - recently finished its second
OL,20, series on BBC1, and after having loved 
OL,21, the first series, I was shocked.

OL,6, I never expected a second series, but  
OL,7, it was excited shock, and I've finally 
OL,8, almost completed this new run on       
OL,9, iPlayer.                               
OL,11, It's a delight! Characters who are     
OL,12, essentially pretty damn repugnant,     
OL,13, doing terrible things to each other and
OL,14, others. That shouldn't be great fun to 
OL,15, watch, but it is (like Succession).    
OL,17, Although, there is some love for these 
OL,18, characters now. In times of            
OL,19, vulnerability, I have really felt for  
OL,20, them. I cannot wait for the final      
OL,21, climax - and hope they will be back!
