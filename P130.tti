OL,18, Interior Design Master with Alan Carr  
OL,19, is back for a second series, upgraded

OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G2/6
OL,6, With a new design challenge every week,
OL,7, and the familiar show tropes of judges 
OL,8, and the elimination of a contestant    
OL,9, every week, this could be a rubbish    
OL,10, programme. It could also be very       
OL,11, pretentious, some of the contestants   
OL,12, are in danger of disappearing into     
OL,13, their own dream world!                 
OL,15, However, the judges really make you    
OL,16, believe in the importance of great     
OL,17, design, particularly main judge        
OL,18, Michelle Ogundehin. She's not only     
OL,19, really likeable, and caring and sparks 
OL,20, off the others, but she has a line of  
OL,21, steel running through her.

OL,6, And there's Alan Carr of course, who   
OL,7, makes the show for me!                 
OL,9, His humour cuts through it all, just   
OL,10, when you think the theme and those     
OL,11, taking part is getting ridiculous,     
OL,12, Alan's comments bring it all back down 
OL,13, to Earth again! Brilliant!             
OL,15, One show that's possibly beyond saving 
OL,16, is The Apprentice, which reached the   
OL,17, 17th final this week. Yes, I watched   
OL,18, it....but no, I don't enjoy it as much 
OL,19, as I used to.                          
OL,21, It's pure panto these days,

OL,6, so scripted it's untrue - yes, it      
OL,7, always was, but come on! Also, the     
OL,8, contestants are so aware now, having   
OL,9, admitted to watching the programme as  
OL,10, children, it's become a parody of      
OL,11, itself.                                
OL,13, And they're not convincing             
OL,14, entrepreneurs - the finalists were     
OL,15, proposing partnerships in selling      
OL,16, desserts and matching pyjamas! Erm...  
OL,18, It's a sad decline, the early days     
OL,19, really impressed, with genuinely great 
OL,20, concepts. Time for you to be fired, The
OL,21, Apprentice!

OL,6, Finally this week, I've had a recent   
OL,7, recommendation, to watch Upload on     
OL,8, Amazon!                                
OL,10, I'm five episodes in and hooked        
OL,11, already!                               
OL,13, It's a great idea - set in a future    
OL,14, when people no longer have to die and  
OL,15, then never be heard from again!        
OL,17, They can have their souls uploaded into
OL,18, a virtual reality heaven - depending on
OL,19, how much you pay of course!            
OL,21, It's really well made, great touches.

OL,6, Running through it, as you can imagine,
OL,7, are some morals to the tale - what     
OL,8, loves means, friendship means, material
OL,9, pleasures versus personal ones.        
OL,11, There's also, without giving away the  
OL,12, plot, a bit of a mystery and intrigue  
OL,13, around how our uploaded hero Nathan    
OL,14, ended up 'dead' in the first place!    
OL,16, I can't wait to binge through it, two  
OL,17, series having already been made.       
OL,18, Another one on the ever growing list!  
OL,20, Time to seek out other hidden gems, and
OL,21, share them with you in coming weeks!
