OL,6, This week's telly: The Oscars 2022 -

OL,9, Schedule                               
OL,11, I think it's quite obvious that there's
OL,12, one programme I will mention this week 
OL,13, - one that we have all been talking    
OL,14, about at some point!                   
OL,16, The Oscars, intended to make a         
OL,17, comeback, with the first ceremony back 
OL,18, to 'normal' after Covid restrictions - 
OL,19, it certainly made a comeback for all   
OL,20, the wrong reasons!

OL,6, I love an awards show, and The Oscars  
OL,7, is the big one of them all! With a     
OL,8, promising line up of nominees, I was   
OL,9, keen to watch those highlights later   
OL,10, the same day. Waking up to the news    
OL,11, about Will Smith slapping Chris Rock   
OL,12, was unbelievable.                      
OL,14, I've seen the footage many times and   
OL,15, still remain flabbergasted by this     
OL,16, event. And watching Will's tearful     
OL,17, acceptance speech moments later, I sat 
OL,18, open mouthed. Yet the controversy is   
OL,19, not for here. The rest of the show felt
OL,20, slick and a welcome return for this    
OL,21, juggernaut of showbiz- albeit shocking!

OL,6, Banned! The Mary Whitehouse Story - my 
OL,7, immediate default position on this     
OL,8, woman is not to give her any airtime!  
OL,10, A two part story of the ultimate       
OL,11, busybody, who campaigned to halt what  
OL,12, she saw as our decline into a mire of  
OL,13, filth! She felt television was         
OL,14, reflecting a permissive society we were
OL,15, all being hauled into.                 
OL,17, What on Earth would she make of today's
OL,18, programming?! Mary was almost a parody 
OL,19, herself, the kind of figure you'd      
OL,20, imagine hitting you over the head with 
OL,21, her umbrella, ranting with disgust.

OL,6, Of course, I do believe there needs to 
OL,7, be an upholding of standards - and this
OL,8, documentary is worth watching as an    
OL,9, insight into this woman's mission and  
OL,10, the impact she made.                   
OL,12, There's an argument that she did some  
OL,13, good, but I'm never convinced, I don't 
OL,14, think those standards were to be upheld
OL,15, by you, dear Mary!                     
OL,17, Finally this week, I'd like to focus on
OL,18, a little channel that seems to be      
OL,19, punching above it's own weight all of a
OL,20, sudden!

OL,6, Have you ever watched That's TV? Here  
OL,7, in sunny Norfolk, it first came to my  
OL,8, attention after our local channel      
OL,9, Mustard TV on Freeview shut down! The  
OL,10, replacement was That's Norfolk, from   
OL,11, That's TV.                             
OL,13, This was a half hearted attempt at a   
OL,14, few local news bulletins and magazine  
OL,15, programmes (worse than Mustard had     
OL,16, been), which quickly seemed to fizzle  
OL,17, out and disappear.                     
OL,19, Over time, the channel has evolved -   
OL,20, initially by showing music videos, a   
OL,21, loop of 70s, 80s and 90s tunes.

OL,6, Further airtime was filled with war    
OL,7, documentaries and a few other random   
OL,8, slices of culture.                     
OL,10, The final phase has been comedy - The  
OL,11, Benny Hill Show, Kenny Everett and     
OL,12, Frankie Howerd have all been           
OL,13, introduced, some classic broadcasts    
OL,14, that we'd never see anywhere else. This
OL,15, got my interest, and many others too.  
OL,17, Now it's the first channel to repeat   
OL,18, Monty Python in 20 years, adding Whose 
OL,19, Line Is It Anyway, Russ Abbot, Hale and
OL,20, Pace and Mrs Merton into the mix! What 
OL,21, a treasure trove, join in the fun!
