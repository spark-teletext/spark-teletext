OL,6, This week's telly: The Savoy (ITV);    
OL,7, Thatcher: A Very British Revolution    
OL,8, (BBC4); Who Do You Think You Are (BBC1)
OL,10, The Savoy is a programme that I ought  
OL,11, to love...and I do to an extent! One of
OL,12, my favourite genres is the behind the  
OL,13, scenes documentary, particularly when  
OL,14, it comes to plush hotels.              
OL,16, However, this isn't quite like the BBC 
OL,17, Claridge's documentary that I have     
OL,18, recently relived via YouTube. ITV      
OL,19, unfortunately have ruined part of The  
OL,20, Savoy - yes it has some fine scenes of 
OL,21, the services on offer to those guests,

OL,6, and I do enjoy seeing the mini stories 
OL,7, developing - but the 'characters' are a
OL,8, bit over the top, a bit desperate to be
OL,9, on telly, and can get more than a bit  
OL,10, annoying!                              
OL,12, Plus, they are in danger of milking the
OL,13, show too much, I fear it may overrun by
OL,14, a series or two. It's becoming a rare  
OL,15, hotel doc that I may steer clear of.   
OL,17, BBC4 - which may soon be leaving us (a 
OL,18, scandal, disgusting if it isn't saved),
OL,19, served up a fine repeat of Thatcher: A 
OL,20, Very British Revolution. One well worth
OL,21, rewatching, at the penultimate show.

OL,6, It's gripping to see the footage of    
OL,7, Thatcher - love her or loathe her, she 
OL,8, was certainly engaging.                
OL,10, It's fascinating to see the events of  
OL,11, those years, compared with what we are 
OL,12, seeing now in politics. She knew what  
OL,13, she wanted, she wasn't wishy washy, she
OL,14, stuck to her guns! This episode        
OL,15, highlighted her work in dismantling    
OL,16, some of the economy's traditions, to   
OL,17, transform the country's fortunes.      
OL,19, However, as we see in this documentary 
OL,20, series, when she wouldn't listen to    
OL,21, those around her it was doom.

OL,6, Including her own cabinet...it was her 
OL,7, downfall. Tune in next week for the    
OL,8, end! The story of a leadership         
OL,9, unravelled!                            
OL,11, Who Do You Think You Are has always    
OL,12, been a fine series, but with the more  
OL,13, recent episodes there are indications  
OL,14, it has run its course. Sometimes, it   
OL,15, loses its way and isn't holding the    
OL,16, audience in the same way.              
OL,18, This run has turned that around again  
OL,19, though! Matt Lucas, Anna Maxwell Martin
OL,20, et al have been wonderful, I've loved  
OL,21, it.

OL,6, This week, Ralf Little! The Royle      
OL,7, Family and Death In Paradise star is so
OL,8, likeable, I was smiling from the moment
OL,9, it began.                              
OL,11, His search began by describing the     
OL,12, family links for Manchester and nearby 
OL,13, Bury, and how they became scattered    
OL,14, across the country too.                
OL,16, The journey led to finding his great   
OL,17, grandfather was a Welsh international  
OL,18, footballer - heart warming tales ensued
OL,19, and Ralf was so proud of this          
OL,20, discovery.

OL,6, Add to that, his feeling that 'there   
OL,7, was always something posh' in part of  
OL,8, the family, that he didn't know more   
OL,9, about. There was money!                
OL,11, This story unfolded to reveal a family 
OL,12, tree branch that was a titled one, and 
OL,13, Ralf visited his distant cousins in    
OL,14, their Nottinghamshire mansion house! I 
OL,15, wonder if they would have welcomed him 
OL,16, so warmly if he'd been working on the  
OL,17, bins?!                                 
OL,19, My doubts around the longevity of this 
OL,20, series have faded, if they can keep    
OL,21, finding star guests, then run and run!
