OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G1/6
OL,6, Last week's telly: Joe Wicks: Facing My
OL,7, Childhood (BBC1); Night Sky (Amazon    
OL,8, Prime Video); The Queen's Platinum     
OL,9, Jubilee Celebration (ITV)              
OL,11, I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of Joe   
OL,12, Wicks - well, I have a love/hate thing 
OL,13, for him. I can see why he is popular,  
OL,14, but at the same time I can find him    
OL,15, incredibly annoying! I'm sure he speaks
OL,16, very highly of me too!                 
OL,18, Joe Wicks: Facing My Childhood was a   
OL,19, moving documentary about his background
OL,20, - coming from a very challenging       
OL,21, beginning has clearly been key.

OL,6, That start in life has given him the   
OL,7, determination to succeed and escape    
OL,8, this traumatic upbringing.             
OL,10, His parents were a drug addicted       
OL,11, father, and a mother suffering with    
OL,12, poor mental health - tales of manic and
OL,13, constant cleaning featured.            
OL,15, This is where I put my previous        
OL,16, thoughts aside, and I had to admire his
OL,17, resilience of course. The way he has   
OL,18, built a wonderful family life of his   
OL,19, own is admirable and the very fact that
OL,20, he remains so upbeat and positive is a 
OL,21, major feat in itself!

OL,6, I'd notice the teaser trailer for Night
OL,7, Sky on Amazon a few weeks back, and    
OL,8, became very keen to check out this new 
OL,9, series!                                
OL,11, The whole lot has dropped on Amazon    
OL,12, Prime Video now, and I have only seen  
OL,13, the first episode so far, but it's off 
OL,14, to a great start!                      
OL,16, The whole premise is certainly a unique
OL,17, one - Sissy Spacek and J.K. Simmons    
OL,18, play long time married couple Irene and
OL,19, Franklin York. They live a quiet life  
OL,20, together that reveals nothing          
OL,21, unusual...at first.

OL,6, However, it turns out that their shed  
OL,7, houses a secret chamber that leads to a
OL,8, deserted planet - a place they have    
OL,9, been visited countless times over many 
OL,10, years, without anything changing.      
OL,12, There are moments of secret and        
OL,13, intrigue, talk of mortality as they are
OL,14, reaching such an advanced age. And the 
OL,15, end of episode one reveals the arrival 
OL,16, of a mysterious young man - who is he, 
OL,17, and why is he there?                   
OL,19, I'm gripped already, ready to see more 
OL,20, and may well binge the lot! Sissy and  
OL,21, J.K. are so engaging too, quality stuff

OL,6, The Queen's Platinum Jubilee           
OL,7, Celebration on ITV was over two hours, 
OL,8, kind of kicking off the many Jubilee   
OL,9, programmes to come.                    
OL,11, It was almost in the style of an       
OL,12, historic Royal jousting event, the     
OL,13, Queen in an arena, overseeing horse    
OL,14, show displays, singing, tributes,      
OL,15, acting.                                
OL,17, Helen Mirren's appearance as Elizabeth 
OL,18, I was dramatic and something that the  
OL,19, press have reported the Queen not being
OL,20, impressed by. You try sitting there for
OL,21, two hours at 96 years old!

OL,6, Amazes me that they expect her to have 
OL,7, a big grin continuously!               
OL,9, The Queen did display her great sense  
OL,10, of humour though, with comedic         
OL,11, references to her choosing this over   
OL,12, Parliament etc., and she clearly       
OL,13, enjoyed that!                          
OL,15, I definitely feel there is much better 
OL,16, to come on the show front, but this was
OL,17, a great start - and I felt proud to be 
OL,18, British seeing the Queen there and     
OL,19, connecting with her people! We are     
OL,20, living through a special time and      
OL,21, television will play a large part!
