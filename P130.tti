OL,6, This week's telly: RuPaul's Drag Race  
OL,7, (US Season 15) (WOW Presents Plus);    
OL,8, Succession (Sky Atlantic); Charles R   
OL,9, (BBC1)                                 
OL,11, Back in action after a break, I have   
OL,12, dived headlong into a very varied mix  
OL,13, this time around!                      
OL,15, First up, even though the series has   
OL,16, ended, I'm still playing catch up on   
OL,17, RuPaul season 15 - the original US     
OL,18, series, out of the many, many versions 
OL,19, now in place!                          
OL,21, I'm up to the Rusical episode.

OL,6, And it's definitely the usual          
OL,7, technicolour, rollercoaster ride of rip
OL,8, roaring drag filled fun!               
OL,10, I've followed Ru from her beginnings,  
OL,11, and will continue to do so. This has   
OL,12, all the hallmarks and formula of       
OL,13, previous series, so in some ways it    
OL,14, doesn't even matter what I tell you    
OL,15, about it!                              
OL,17, There is still bitching and infighting,
OL,18, there is hilarity, there are poignant  
OL,19, and tear jerking sob stories...all of  
OL,20, it is here.

OL,6, However, the very volume of episodes   
OL,7, we've seen is naturally diluting the   
OL,8, source now.                            
OL,10, Some things are becoming too samey, and
OL,11, some contestants are reminding me of   
OL,12, contestants from previous years!       
OL,13, Something that didn't really happen    
OL,14, before...Should Ru be changing things? 
OL,15, Or end on a high?                      
OL,17, Ending on a high is something that     
OL,18, Succession is certainly going to do,   
OL,19, when the final series concludes in a   
OL,20, few weeks time.

OL,6, Jessie Armstrong and co really, really 
OL,7, know what they are doing with this     
OL,8, show. It's way up there in my all time 
OL,9, faves. And now, even when the centre of
OL,10, the universe is absent, it's so        
OL,11, brilliant.                             
OL,13, Brian Cox, as Logan Roy, always made it
OL,14, for me - always admired as an actor,   
OL,15, and he so brilliantly embodied the old 
OL,16, megalomaniac. I didn't think the cast  
OL,17, could manage without him, but I think  
OL,18, I'm being proven wrong - brilliant plot
OL,19, moves, and such clever writing.        
OL,21, What are you doing next weekend?

OL,6, I for one will be glued to the coverage
OL,7, of the Coronation of King Charles III  
OL,8, and Queen Camilla (head back here      
OL,9, afterwards to find out what I          
OL,10, thought!).                             
OL,12, Of course, there will be a long warm   
OL,13, up, with many documentaries and        
OL,14, features in the coming days, to prepare
OL,15, us for the momentous occasion!         
OL,17, Charles R - in his own words - was a   
OL,18, superbly executed journey through his  
OL,19, life, prepared and preparing for what  
OL,20, was to come.

OL,6, From childhood, including attending his
OL,7, mother's coronation, through school    
OL,8, days, the first marriage to Diana,     
OL,9, fatherhood, Camilla, and the many life 
OL,10, lessons he's had in the build up to his
OL,11, destiny as King.                       
OL,13, It strikes me that he didn't seem ready
OL,14, for a very long time, and even though  
OL,15, he becomes King at a great age, it's   
OL,16, the right age for him.                 
OL,18, He seems gentler, kinder, and more in  
OL,19, touch with his 'subjects' than ever    
OL,20, before. And I can't wait for the pomp  
OL,21, and ceremony that we do so well!
