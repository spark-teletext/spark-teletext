OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G1/6
OL,6, This week's telly: The Talk (TalkTV);  
OL,7, Billie: In Search of Billie Holiday    
OL,8, (BBC4); RuPaul's Drag Race USA (WOW    
OL,9, Presents Plus)                         
OL,11, Well, last week I was praising some of 
OL,12, the launch of TalkTV - not all of      
OL,13, course, as it's definitely not all to  
OL,14, my taste! However, it was slick and had
OL,15, big names - and was certainly more     
OL,16, impressive at what they wanted to do   
OL,17, than GB News was at launch!            
OL,19, However, there were news stories this  
OL,20, week of zero viewing figures and the   
OL,21, audience leaving in droves!

OL,6, That may be so, but I am still drawn to
OL,7, check out more of the new channel.     
OL,9, The Talk, the nightly panel show       
OL,10, presented by Sharon Osbourne, is       
OL,11, already going through some drama!      
OL,13, Sharon herself, she of the fifth       
OL,14, facelift and odd inability to present  
OL,15, it properly, has now departed for the  
OL,16, USA - Ozzy has Covid and she's         
OL,17, naturally going to be with him.        
OL,19, Will she return? The show has spoken to
OL,20, her by video call, but has actually    
OL,21, continued to be likely stronger!

OL,4,A`CA REVIEW OF THE TV WEEKA`````````G3/6
OL,6, I tuned in to see Vanessa Feltz leading
OL,7, more than one edition. Say what you    
OL,8, like about Vanessa, but she's          
OL,9, intelligent and can carry a show with  
OL,10, confidence!                            
OL,12, She also sparks lively debate and works
OL,13, well with panellists like Ian Collins  
OL,14, and the vile Isabel Oakeshott. Not only
OL,15, that, but Mel B joined in too! Always  
OL,16, love a bit of Scary Spice! It made for 
OL,17, a rather enjoyable edition or two!     
OL,18, Don't rush back, Sharon!               
OL,20, BBC4's Friday music nights continue to 
OL,21, produce gems, and this week too!

OL,6, It was jazz night - tributes to Nina   
OL,7, Simone, concerts by Ella Fitzgerald and
OL,8, Louis Armstrong - and the documentary  
OL,9, Billie: In Search of Billie Holiday.   
OL,11, This was a fascinating trawl through a 
OL,12, stellar and tragic life, of a true jazz
OL,13, great whom I have always loved!        
OL,15, A real mix of music clips, talking     
OL,16, heads from so many who knew her and    
OL,17, it's surprising how many of those are  
OL,18, still around today.                    
OL,20, She was an icon, who changed music and 
OL,21, also impacted equal rights.

OL,6, She blazed a trail for black women, so 
OL,7, ahead of her time - but as with many   
OL,8, artists, she had demons that she could 
OL,9, not overcome and we lost her far too   
OL,10, soon!                                  
OL,12, RuPaul's Drag Race, having had a home  
OL,13, on Netflix for some time, has now      
OL,14, withdrawn the latest USA series 14 -   
OL,15, along with some other franchise        
OL,16, editions - so that we can only watch it
OL,17, by subscribing to WOW Presents Plus    
OL,18, streaming service.                     
OL,20, So, I kept hearing good reviews of     
OL,21, series 14, and relented and subscribed!

OL,6, I'm glad I did, the juggernaut of the  
OL,7, original show has been rejuvenated once
OL,8, more on this evidence!                 
OL,10, A very strong opening, with a pleasing 
OL,11, array of contestants this time around. 
OL,12, Ru is my main reason for tuning in     
OL,13, though, and always impresses me.       
OL,15, Not only that, the openers special     
OL,16, guest judge is singer Lizzo, who was   
OL,17, such good value and adds to the        
OL,18, entertaining mix!                      
OL,20, If you enjoy Drag Race, there's plenty 
OL,21, on WOW to enjoy, so check it out today!
