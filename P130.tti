OL,6, This week's telly: Louis Theroux       
OL,7, Interviews: Dame Judi Dench            
OL,8, (BBC2);Charles: Our New King           
OL,9, (ITV);EastEnders (BBC1)                
OL,11, I've always been a massive fan of Louis
OL,12, Theroux, always tuning in for his many 
OL,13, shows over the years.                  
OL,15, He returns with a new series of        
OL,16, celebrity interviews, and this week was
OL,17, a fantastic watch - with Dame Judi     
OL,18, Dench.                                 
OL,20, It's not much use if you don't like    
OL,21, these folk, but I love them!

OL,6, The whole interview, to me, was        
OL,7, fascinating, funny and heart-warming. I
OL,8, adored every minute.                   
OL,10, Dame Judi still has amazing spark and  
OL,11, wit, and they played off each other    
OL,12, wonderfully! Into her late eighties    
OL,13, now, our Dame has a cracking sense of  
OL,14, humour and is as sharp as a tack!      
OL,16, Interestingly too, we gained valuable  
OL,17, insight into her family life. I        
OL,18, remember the stories of her grandson   
OL,19, moving in during lockdown, and it was  
OL,20, quite moving to hear more about that - 
OL,21, and see more of them together.

OL,6, Louis is on to a winner by coming back 
OL,7, with this intimate series. I hope it   
OL,8, hasn't peaked too soon!                
OL,10, Charles: Our New King - a new portrait 
OL,11, of the monarch, our new King Charles   
OL,12, III (still feels a bit strange saying  
OL,13, that!), was surprisingly heavyweight   
OL,14, and quality for ITV. It felt like the  
OL,15, kind of documentary the BBC would      
OL,16, produce.                               
OL,18, Our new King does come across so well, 
OL,19, I have to say. Either a lot has evolved
OL,20, over the years image wise, or the spin 
OL,21, doctors really are geniuses!

OL,6, Flit back to the Nineties, and Charles 
OL,7, definitely did not seem to be the same 
OL,8, man - and maybe that is purely down to 
OL,9, the image we were all sold!            
OL,11, Now, seeing the way he and Queen       
OL,12, Consort Camilla conduct themselves, it 
OL,13, makes me confident in the future of the
OL,14, monarchy. As noted in the programme, it
OL,15, seems he will slim down the Royal      
OL,16, Family - when it comes to who will be a
OL,17, working royal.                         
OL,19, And that makes perfect sense, given    
OL,20, it's worked so well for other European 
OL,21, Royals, and maintaining their status.

OL,6, Watch this space though, for           
OL,7, potentially tougher times ahead. It's  
OL,8, also been in the news about Prince     
OL,9, Harry's upcoming book launch! This is  
OL,10, sure to bring further turmoil and      
OL,11, challenges ahead for our new King.     
OL,13, I've not visited Albert Square for a   
OL,14, while, and after watching a chunk of   
OL,15, EastEnders this week I'm not sure I    
OL,16, want to become immersed again.         
OL,18, I do get the feeling that the quality  
OL,19, is improving, compared with the last   
OL,20, time I tuned in!

OL,6, Some of the storyline threads don't    
OL,7, seem quite as ridiculous as they were, 
OL,8, and scenes seem to be well written and 
OL,9, acted.                                 
OL,11, However, some aspects really grate - do
OL,12, we really need to see Alfie Moon back?!
OL,13, It's a revolving door, and one some    
OL,14, characters should not come back        
OL,15, through!                               
OL,17, Also, the main storyline now is Lola - 
OL,18, terminally ill with a brain tumour.    
OL,19, Something to cheer us all up, in these 
OL,20, challenging times! It may be well acted
OL,21, and researched, but please give us joy!
