OL,6, Sally Wainwright is a genius, probably 
OL,7, the greatest writer in British         
OL,8, television today, her formula is pure  
OL,9, gold.                                  
OL,11, Sarah Lancashire returns, with the     
OL,12, strong supporting cast of James Norton 
OL,13, and Siobhan Finneran. Arch nemesis     
OL,14, Tommy is back, but the focus of episode
OL,15, one was more around the storyline of a 
OL,16, controlling teacher and his drug       
OL,17, addicted wife - straight in there with 
OL,18, the heavy stuff!                       
OL,20, I'm hooked already, and can't wait for 
OL,21, more. How have we held out for so long?

OL,6, Sarah Lancashire is an actress I never 
OL,7, used to admire that much - yeah, great 
OL,8, as Racquel in Corrie etc, but was she  
OL,9, really THAT good?! Happy Valley was the
OL,10, making of her, and with vast experience
OL,11, and now "Julia" breaking the US for    
OL,12, her, she really is one of our best.    
OL,14, James Norton is another revelation,    
OL,15, thanks in part to this series. When you
OL,16, see him interviewed (he was on Graham  
OL,17, Norton this week), you'd never believe 
OL,18, it's the same man.                     
OL,20, Another televisual return has been to  
OL,21, Claridge's hotel.

OL,6, After a previous BBC2 series, which    
OL,7, explores the day to day workings of the
OL,8, luxury London landmark, we head back to
OL,9, witness a major revamp.                
OL,11, I visited Claridge's last year, for    
OL,12, afternoon tea and cocktails, and was   
OL,13, totally smitten. It's something        
OL,14, special, and I must return soon!       
OL,16, The series follows their plans to      
OL,17, create a spa, and revamp and add more  
OL,18, rooms - to achieve this in a limited   
OL,19, London space, they have to go down and 
OL,20, up!

OL,6, It's immediately apparent how          
OL,7, challenging this is logistically, as   
OL,8, the hotel management plan to keep the  
OL,9, place open whilst they undertake the   
OL,10, changes.                               
OL,12, They get into territory that fascinates
OL,13, me - tunnelling down below quite       
OL,14, precarious foundations, squeezing      
OL,15, excavation equipment into lift shafts  
OL,16, that contain essential plumbing and    
OL,17, electrical equipment. It's a scary     
OL,18, business, and the people that make this
OL,19, happen are geniuses!                   
OL,21, Next stop this year has to be the spa!

OL,6, Our final "return" this week isn't a   
OL,7, new series, but a welcome rerun!       
OL,9, Howards' Way is back, on Drama, and we 
OL,10, can relive the gloriously bonkers      
OL,11, sailing saga from 1985.                
OL,13, Our answer to the likes of Dynasty, it 
OL,14, ran for five years, centred initially  
OL,15, on Tom Howard and his family. Made     
OL,16, redundant as a boat designer, he       
OL,17, invested in the old fashioned Mermaid  
OL,18, Boatyard.                              
OL,20, The series is exciting and so much fun.
OL,21, If you've not seen it, dive in!
