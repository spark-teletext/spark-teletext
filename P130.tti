OL,15, TV+!

OL,18, following a free trial, but I have     
OL,19, realised there's so much to watch...so 
OL,20, it's staying, at least for now!

OL,6, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters continues a
OL,7, resurgence of the Godzilla legend! I've
OL,8, always been drawn to it, and there's   
OL,9, probably no point watching if you don't
OL,10, feel the same!                         
OL,12, Right back to when I used to watch the 
OL,13, kids' cartoon series Godzilla (with    
OL,14, Godzukey, remember him?!), it has      
OL,15, fascinated me..and I used to watch the 
OL,16, classic Japanese movies on Channel 4   
OL,17, too!                                   
OL,19, This new series, with parallel         
OL,20, timelines of storyline, and the        
OL,21, grizzled appearance of Kurt Russell,

OL,6, has held my interest straight away. A  
OL,7, great cast, strong story, and of course
OL,8, awaiting brilliant special effects     
OL,9, every time Godzilla or another Titan   
OL,10, monster appears! I am loving it..      
OL,12, True Detective: Night Country - the    
OL,13, fourth series of the anthology that    
OL,14, began with Matthew McConaughey and     
OL,15, Woody Harrelson (still executive       
OL,16, producers) has been a long time coming.
OL,18, Well worth wait it seems, after two    
OL,19, episodes! We have a strong cast, led by
OL,20, Jodie Foster - and also featuring one  
OL,21, of my faves, Fiona Shaw. And it's odd!

OL,6, Like Fortitude, the arctic circle set  
OL,7, supernatural thriller, don't come to   
OL,8, this expecting something conventional! 
OL,10, A team of scientists are dead,         
OL,11, seemingly having met their end at the  
OL,12, hands of something terrifying, and     
OL,13, possibly not human. And the town of    
OL,14, Ennis, and it's surroundings, make for 
OL,15, a strange atmosphere. Quirky characters
OL,16, abound, with Jodie's law enforcement   
OL,17, and her team trying to maintain some   
OL,18, semblance of normality.                
OL,20, For such a cold climate, it's pretty   
OL,21, warming and heartfelt in places...

OL,6, Also unsettling, and I'm more than     
OL,7, happy to get lost in the snow and ice. 
OL,9, Elaine Paige at the BBC was part of    
OL,10, BBC2's latest music night - along with 
OL,11, documentaries about Andrew Lloyd-Webber
OL,12, and Elaine Paige in concert and also   
OL,13, choosing her favourite musical tracks. 
OL,15, This is proper variety, Saturday night 
OL,16, entertainment that is old school in the
OL,17, best possible way. Such talent was on  
OL,18, display, reminding us of a rich West   
OL,19, End and Broadway heritage - and I'm not
OL,20, even a huge musicals fan, but this was 
OL,21, amazing stuff, worth extra on iPlayer!
