OL,6, This week's telly: 9/11: Life Under    
OL,7, Attack - ITV; Parkinson: The Goons -   
OL,8, BBC4; The Big Breakfast - Channel 4    
OL,10, As we got closer to the 20th           
OL,11, anniversary of 9/11, the schedules made
OL,12, way for even more footage - with 9/11: 
OL,13, Life Under Attack providing a survivors
OL,14, and eyewitness view, using huge amounts
OL,15, of footage from the first moments of   
OL,16, that sunny and warm day in New York    
OL,17, City.                                  
OL,19, Whereas the BBC documentaries I        
OL,20, reviewed last week were of an entirely 
OL,21, different nature.

OL,6, Both were talking heads pieces, whereas
OL,7, this production was comprised purely of
OL,8, footage taken by members of the public 
OL,9, that day.                              
OL,11, It was no less powerful, in some       
OL,12, instances even more so! How terrifying 
OL,13, it was in many moments, staggering in  
OL,14, the view that unfolded in front of     
OL,15, those going about their usual day.     
OL,17, The moment the first plane hit was     
OL,18, captured in raw detail - a huge bang, a
OL,19, ground shifting, seismic movement that 
OL,20, made people stop in their tracks.

OL,6, The cameras pointed up, screaming,     
OL,7, debris falling, flames - total horror! 
OL,8, For an hour and a half, I was gripped, 
OL,9, feeling mesmerised and right there with
OL,10, them.                                  
OL,12, Several other sections will stay with  
OL,13, me - those who were jumping, including 
OL,14, the loud crashes and thuds heard by    
OL,15, those in a lobby, with the realisation 
OL,16, that landing bodies caused those       
OL,17, shattering sounds!                     
OL,19, Firemen running up an escalator to     
OL,20, escape one of the towers, at the very  
OL,21, moment it was collapsing.

OL,6, A race for their lives, with darkness  
OL,7, falling as they were partially buried  
OL,8, in wreckage.                           
OL,10, I could name more, but you get the idea
OL,11, - this was unforgettable...and it      
OL,12, should never leave our minds, to learn 
OL,13, the lessons from history.              
OL,15, Parkinson: The Goons was a handy follow
OL,16, on from the recent celebrations of     
OL,17, Parky's fifty years on the box -       
OL,18, stumbled on by chance, in my guide, on 
OL,19, dear old BBC4.                         
OL,21, This was the kind of retro I love.

OL,6, So easy to watch, a delight for the    
OL,7, eyes! You can simply sit back, relax,  
OL,8, and enjoy the genius before you. Harry 
OL,9, Secombe, Spike Milligan and Peter      
OL,10, Sellers were comedy geniuses.          
OL,12, Just as the style of the programme     
OL,13, does, these gentlemen made it look     
OL,14, effortless. I spent the entire         
OL,15, programme either on the brink of       
OL,16, laughter, or wrapped up in constant    
OL,17, chortling and belly laughs!            
OL,19, Harry Secombe was funny in his own     
OL,20, right - and a brave man, being foil to 
OL,21, the comedy titans by his side.

OL,6, Both Milligan and Sellers had the      
OL,7, ability to crack me up with one look,  
OL,8, one line, even one word spoken in the  
OL,9, correct silly tone. Greats, the lot of 
OL,10, them - if this is the future of repeats
OL,11, on BBC4, then more please!             
OL,13, As part of their Black to Front day of 
OL,14, programming, we were treated to the one
OL,15, off return of The Big Breakfast!       
OL,17, It felt emotional instantly, all of my 
OL,18, retro feelings kicking in from the     
OL,19, moment I saw that house!               
OL,21, I LOVED this show so much...

OL,6, I tuned in daily, from the very first  
OL,7, broadcast with Chris Evans and Gaby    
OL,8, Roslin, sticking with it through thick 
OL,9, and thin - each era (Jonny and Denise, 
OL,10, Jonny and Liza, Richard Bacon..)       
OL,11, bringing its own joys.                 
OL,13, Mo Gilligan and AJ Odudu were sparkling
OL,14, hosts I have to say - so much energy,  
OL,15, humour and the kind of enthusiasm      
OL,16, that's infectious!                     
OL,18, All of those classic features were     
OL,19, there - family of the week, Phil Gayle 
OL,20, reading the news, interviews on the    
OL,21, bed...I want more, will it be back?!
