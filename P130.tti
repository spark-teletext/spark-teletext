OL,6, This week's telly: Craig Charles: UFO  
OL,7, Conspiracies - Sky Showcase; This Is   
OL,8, Use - Disney+; Breakfast - GB News     
OL,10, I've got quite the mixed bag for you   
OL,11, this week! Something awful, something  
OL,12, beautiful and something...er, well,    
OL,13, unsure what it is..                    
OL,15, The awful - Craig Charles: UFO         
OL,16, Conspiracies caught my attention. I    
OL,17, quite like Craig, from his Red Dwarf   
OL,18, days, to his current role on BBC 6Music
OL,19, playing some fine funk and soul tunes! 
OL,21, Also, I am very curious about UFOs!

OL,6, I like to tune into as many shows as   
OL,7, possible on the subject!               
OL,9, Boy, did I regret this choice! The     
OL,10, documentary, seemingly made in his     
OL,11, garage, screams cheapo - like a        
OL,12, thousand different US made docs of its 
OL,13, kind.                                  
OL,15, He also has Sarah, the cynical and     
OL,16, logical science expert, who is there to
OL,17, poo poo his curiosity and also the     
OL,18, sometimes bonkers eyewitness accounts! 
OL,20, Their exchanges are actually           
OL,21, unintentionally hilarious!

OL,6, I lost count of the number of eyebrow  
OL,7, raised faces they shot at each other!  
OL,8, Maybe try it, but don't go back!       
OL,10, This Is Us - something beautiful - is  
OL,11, back for its sixth and final series! My
OL,12, heart is going to break! This has to be
OL,13, one of my all time fave dramas and I   
OL,14, can't get enough of it.                
OL,16, Savouring it one episode release a week
OL,17, on Disney+ (and I think you can still  
OL,18, get it on Amazon, a rights crossover), 
OL,19, I'm so invested in the characters that 
OL,20, when this is over, I may need some     
OL,21, help!

OL,6, The writing is spot on, the characters 
OL,7, so beautifully expanded on across the  
OL,8, breadth of each series - you have      
OL,9, favourites, then they annoy you and it 
OL,10, shifts for a while...just like real    
OL,11, life!                                  
OL,13, It also packs an emotional punch,      
OL,14, making me laugh and then bringing me to
OL,15, tears many times...you are missing out 
OL,16, if you haven't seen this, so treat     
OL,17, yourself now!                          
OL,19, What will happen at the end? The style 
OL,20, of present day, flash backs and flash  
OL,21, forwards is a real teasing strategy.

OL,6, It keeps you gripped, such an enjoyable
OL,7, ride.                                  
OL,9, And my final review this week - I stray
OL,10, onto GB News sometimes, out of         
OL,11, curiosity, in wonder at their changing 
OL,12, face (in some ways).                   
OL,14, The Breakfast show has changed         
OL,15, completely - Kirsty and Simon seemingly
OL,16, gone, and now Eamonn Holmes and Isabel 
OL,17, Webster (formerly Sky News) are in     
OL,18, place. And at the weekend, Anne Diamond
OL,19, is there, with Stephen Dixon (another  
OL,20, Sky News alumni).

OL,6, The set is sunny, the titles something 
OL,7, between effective and amateurish! I    
OL,8, have to say, it clearly shows that     
OL,9, these presenters know what they are    
OL,10, doing...but I'll never be supporting   
OL,11, the right wing bias and am unsure the  
OL,12, style is sustainable.                  
OL,14, It feels like a halfway house between  
OL,15, serious news and debate, and frothy    
OL,16, dancing on the public's doorsteps      
OL,17, magazine like the old TV-am days. Maybe
OL,18, it will work, maybe it won't - am      
OL,19, keeping an eye out for Rupert Murdoch's
OL,20, Talk TV next! Will it kill GB News?!
