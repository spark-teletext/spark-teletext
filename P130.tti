OL,6, This week's telly: The Coronation of HM
OL,7, King Charles III and HM Queen Camilla  
OL,8, (various channels)                     
OL,10, What a week for telly it was, if you're
OL,11, a Royal fan! Which I am, personally!   
OL,12, You won't find any republican leanings 
OL,13, with Sparky, I'm afraid.               
OL,15, With such an event of course, it's a   
OL,16, ripe opportunity to enjoy the coverage 
OL,17, that our television does best.         
OL,19, The BBC is naturally where I would turn
OL,20, to, to me they are the natural home for
OL,21, such pageantry and tradition.

OL,6, Coverage began at 7.30am! Kirsty Young 
OL,7, having already given us a stellar      
OL,8, preview the night before, she was      
OL,9, holding fort, deftly linking together  
OL,10, Huw Edwards commentary of the          
OL,11, procession and ceremony, guests in the 
OL,12, studio, roving reporters with crowds.  
OL,14, It was superb, expertly done - I would 
OL,15, happily tune in for Kirsty Young       
OL,16, reading the phone book! Her return to  
OL,17, broadcasting for the Queen's funeral   
OL,18, was magnificent, and I hope this too is
OL,19, a sign of her coming back to the fore  
OL,20, of the BBC, with much more to come!

OL,6, As the day and the weekend unfolded,   
OL,7, there was rolling news coverage of the 
OL,8, street parties, picnics, charity work  
OL,9, taking place across the nation.        
OL,11, Something broadcasters do very well is 
OL,12, to highlight how we do come together.  
OL,13, Whatever your view of the Royal Family,
OL,14, events like this really do bring people
OL,15, together in a special way.             
OL,17, As I strayed onto other channels, it   
OL,18, only served to make me realise how the 
OL,19, BBC was streets ahead in its quality.  
OL,21, ITV is next rung down..

OL,6, Never the same as the Beeb, but they   
OL,7, try their best, with a slightly more   
OL,8, tabloid style.                         
OL,10, Sky News - a channel that has been     
OL,11, going downhill anyway, let's face it.  
OL,12, It's becoming tired and blander, and   
OL,13, the coverage was only passable.        
OL,15, GB News - with their sometimes slightly
OL,16, amateurish approach, with the usual    
OL,17, presenters and Alastair Stewart popping
OL,18, back from retirement. It's at least    
OL,19, different, and they do well on a       
OL,20, limited budget, so this sometimes      
OL,21, impressed me!

OL,6, Talk TV - only caught a bit of this,   
OL,7, and Vanessa Feltz was on a sofa with   
OL,8, guests nattering about the events from 
OL,9, there in the main...bit bored with the 
OL,10, chat quite quickly really!             
OL,12, The concert on Sunday night was another
OL,13, highlight. In the way it was done, not 
OL,14, so sure about some of the line up!     
OL,16, Also, not sure why Jordan Banjo keeps  
OL,17, appearing, nor who decided he could    
OL,18, present - not keen myself! I guess     
OL,19, somebody has decided he is one of a set
OL,20, to bring in younger viewers?!

OL,6, Something about such concerts that I   
OL,7, always enjoy is seeing the Royals in   
OL,8, that music environment - the kids like 
OL,9, Princess Charlotte were jumping around 
OL,10, to tunes, and members like the Duchess 
OL,11, of Edinburgh grooving to the likes of  
OL,12, Lionel Richie!                         
OL,14, Overall, what a weekend of television  
OL,15, it was! When you think that the Queen's
OL,16, Coronation seventy years ago encouraged
OL,17, the boom in households acquiring their 
OL,18, first TV sets...and now, we all get to 
OL,19, see this historic ceremony, and the    
OL,20, grand tradition of a new era being     
OL,21, ushered in in shared with all of us!
