OL,6, This week's telly: The Crown (Netflix);
OL,7, I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here    
OL,8, (ITV); The English (BBC2)              
OL,10, Bumper week for telly this week, folks,
OL,11, as we head into more wintry weather -  
OL,12, and also hurtle towards Christmas! I   
OL,13, don't know about you, but I'm scared by
OL,14, how fast that is coming around!        
OL,16, Series five of The Crown arrived on    
OL,17, Wednesday! Amazing that this show has  
OL,18, already reached five, it doesn't seem  
OL,19, that long. Yet, at the same time, it's 
OL,20, been a major commitment too. I've loved
OL,21, all previous series.

OL,6, Even when it took some time to get used
OL,7, to the cast changes, once the love     
OL,8, rekindled then the viewer tends to be  
OL,9, in for the long haul.                  
OL,11, This fifth series brings us to the     
OL,12, Nineties, with Imelda Staunton in the  
OL,13, role of Queen. And I have to say, I've 
OL,14, got into this one faster than I did    
OL,15, with the Olivia Colman era.            
OL,17, I've already binged my way through most
OL,18, of the ten episodes. Themes this time  
OL,19, around include the separation of       
OL,20, Charles and Diana, the fire at Windsor,
OL,21, the Al Fayeds...

OL,6, Some significant jumping around in     
OL,7, time, but it's slick and very well     
OL,8, executed.                              
OL,10, Elizabeth Debicki is perfect as Diana, 
OL,11, the mannerisms, voice and style is spot
OL,12, on - and she captures the vulnerability
OL,13, (and potentially the unreasonable side)
OL,14, in a way that suspends any disbelief.  
OL,16, I'm already clamouring for the sixth   
OL,17, and final series and, in spite of the  
OL,18, controversy around this - it was always
OL,19, meant to be partly fiction - I know I  
OL,20, shall keep enjoying.

OL,6, Another show with plenty of news       
OL,7, coverage recently is I'm A Celebrity on
OL,8, ITV! I thought it was a master stroke  
OL,9, getting Boy George on board, somebody I
OL,10, never thought would take part.         
OL,12, However, securing Matt Hancock too,    
OL,13, they certainly knew what they were     
OL,14, doing with that proposal!              
OL,16, I've not seen every episode, but the   
OL,17, ones I have seemed to initially build  
OL,18, the tension, to a level that would have
OL,19, Fleet Street salivating.               
OL,21, However, now it seems to die down.

OL,6, Even the outspoken George is likely to 
OL,7, have said his piece and moved on. Maybe
OL,8, this won't blow up as you expected,    
OL,9, ITV?                                   
OL,11, It'll be interesting to see how it pans
OL,12, out, and if this year has paid off,    
OL,13, after a slightly downbeat couple of UK 
OL,14, based years. Although my Mum thinks    
OL,15, they aren't really in Oz, and it's     
OL,16, studio based!                          
OL,18, Finally this week, I implore you -     
OL,19, please, please watch The English! This 
OL,20, drama is incredible already, and I have
OL,21, only watched the first two episodes.

OL,6, Emily Blunt is magnificent - as she    
OL,7, always is - playing a woman in search  
OL,8, of those responsible for her son's     
OL,9, death, in the Wild West - back in the  
OL,10, 1800s when Wyoming had only just been  
OL,11, established.                           
OL,13, The storyline grips, the cinematography
OL,14, of the glorious landscapes is          
OL,15, incredible, and the supporting cast    
OL,16, thrills.                               
OL,18, After twists and turns already, I      
OL,19, cannot wait to see how it pans out. And
OL,20, it proves, once again, Hugo Blick has  
OL,21, the Midas touch - the genius creator!
