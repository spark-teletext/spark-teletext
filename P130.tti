OL,6, This week's telly: Curb Your Enthusiasm
OL,7, - Sky Comedy; Our Yorkshire Farm -     
OL,8, Channel 5; Halloween viewing - various 
OL,10, Larry's back! One of my favourite ever 
OL,11, comedy creations returned to Sky this  
OL,12, week. It's quite staggering that this  
OL,13, is series eleven, but the quality      
OL,14, remains high.                          
OL,16, If you've never watched Curb Your      
OL,17, Enthusiasm before, you're missing out. 
OL,18, It's the ultimate in cringe, social    
OL,19, anxiety style comedy.                  
OL,21, Larry, played by Larry David

OL,6, (he's playing himself - and says it's  
OL,7, not too far removed from the real him) 
OL,8, is a grumpy, cynical, embarrassing     
OL,9, Hollywood writer. The premise involves 
OL,10, Larry, his friends, occasionally his   
OL,11, ex-wife, new girlfriends and random    
OL,12, strangers - all being sucked into his  
OL,13, orbit of embarrassment.                
OL,15, Every episode means he'll put a foot   
OL,16, wrong, show himself up, make a huge    
OL,17, faux pas - sometimes accidentally when 
OL,18, his intentions are good, sometimes as a
OL,19, result of arguing with people and being
OL,20, incredibly grumpy.

OL,6, It is a genius show and I won't spoil  
OL,7, any episodes here, suffice to say if   
OL,8, you are new to Larry - you have ten    
OL,9, series of hilarity to catch up on!     
OL,11, Our Yorkshire Farm recently returned to
OL,12, Channel 5 and I'm playing catch up.    
OL,13, Part of my TV review ought to include  
OL,14, those shows still doing well on catch  
OL,15, up, because like me I'm sure you're    
OL,16, behind on some shows also!             
OL,18, Amanda Owen and her beautiful family   
OL,19, were onto a winner, even in lockdowns. 
OL,20, The return of the series showed the    
OL,21, impact of the second lockdown -

OL,6, home schooling, blizzard conditions,   
OL,7, the circle of life and death with      
OL,8, animals.                               
OL,10, Like me, you may have fallen for this  
OL,11, family - and it's wonderful to see the 
OL,12, kids grow and the way they all help on 
OL,13, the farm and have such a bond with each
OL,14, other and the animals. I'm still       
OL,15, affected by the passing away of their  
OL,16, beloved Shetland pony!                 
OL,18, As they progress to lambing season,    
OL,19, there's nothing like a farming series  
OL,20, to remind us that life goes on, no     
OL,21, matter what challenges are there.

OL,6, The season of the witch is here! As    
OL,7, this weekend marks another Halloween,  
OL,8, television has never been so full of   
OL,9, spooky shows and creepy creations to   
OL,10, frighten you!                          
OL,12, If you're keen on some spooky          
OL,13, streaming, Netflix has onboarded a     
OL,14, number of classics to set the mood -   
OL,15, the original Halloween, what a classic!
OL,16, Halloween 2 - still a great choice,    
OL,17, Halloween 3: Season of the Witch - a   
OL,18, departure story and improved reputation
OL,19, over the years, Halloween 4 and 5 -    
OL,20, trashy sequels, but I still love them!
