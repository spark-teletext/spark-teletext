OL,6,GTVARK is an online museum. The site is 
OL,7, intended as a tribute to the work of   
OL,8, television presentation and graphics,  
OL,9, and to preserve a slice of our social  
OL,10, history.                               
OL,12, Through images and video clips, we     
OL,13, present these modest little chunks of  
OL,14, television that are never repeated:    
OL,15, idents, promos, opening titles, Public 
OL,16, Information Films, commercials, start- 
OL,17, ups and closedowns, break bumpers and  
OL,18, station clocks.                        
OL,20, Each item is accompanied by a short    
OL,21, written analysis and review.

OL,6, TVARK is a non-commercial and non-     
OL,7, profit making organisation, our server 
OL,8, costs are funded by our team members.  
OL,10, It was started on the 8th November     
OL,11, 1998 in the dial-up era, as one man's  
OL,12, hobby, called 'Television Ark'. Over   
OL,13, the years, as the site has grown, 10   
OL,14, people become involved, all passionate 
OL,15, about TV and all of whom have brought  
OL,16, clips from their own collections of    
OL,17, off-air television recordings.         
OL,19, We also received donations from other  
OL,20, collectors, and the site now has over  
OL,21, 20,000 vintage recordings.
