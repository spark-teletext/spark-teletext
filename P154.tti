OL,6, Whenever people talk about the 1980's  
OL,7, they usually call it "the decade that  
OL,8, fashion forgot" or "the rise of        
OL,9, Thatcher". Fashion and politics aside  
OL,10, however the 1980's was an incredible   
OL,11, decade to experience especially the TV 
OL,12, shows that existed back then.          
OL,14, British terrestrial television in the  
OL,15, 1980's had what no other decade had -  
OL,16, it had the very best TV shows from     
OL,17, previous decades as well as its own    
OL,18, amazing shows. I was a kid in the      
OL,19, 1980's and I watched a lot of kids TV  
OL,20, as well as a lot of gameshows.

OL,6, The kids shows in the 1980's could be  
OL,7, easily split into two categories - the 
OL,8, British kids show that taught the      
OL,9, children morals and values with shows  
OL,10, aimed at younger kids having certain   
OL,11, professions as the core character      
OL,12, outline (a postman in Postman Pat,     
OL,13, factory workers in Bertha and a junk   
OL,14, shop owner in Bric-a-Brac) and the     
OL,15, American kids cartoons that essentially
OL,16, screamed "here s what s available in   
OL,17, your nearest toy shop soon so go and   
OL,18, pester your parents to buy it for you!"

OL,6, Because genre-specific satellite       
OL,7, channels was still a glint in Rupert   
OL,8, Murdoch's eye at the time it was left  
OL,9, up to the three (soon to be followed by
OL,10, four) terrestrial channels to show the 
OL,11, best of the 1960's and 1970's - but    
OL,12, only as long as they were shot in that 
OL,13, new-fangled thing called colour.       
OL,15, This was why episodes of the Morecambe 
OL,16, and Wise Show were still favourites    
OL,17, even after Eric's sad passing before   
OL,18, the decade had reached half distance   
OL,19, and why, as a kid, I got to experience 
OL,20, the delights of the residents of       
OL,21, Trumpton.

OL,6, 1980's British TV also gave us         
OL,7, Breakfast TV (along with a puppet rat  
OL,8, and a mad bloke hitting kids over the  
OL,9, head with a hammer) while over the pond
OL,10, in America they were making some       
OL,11, action-packed shows that found its way 
OL,12, over here featuring things such as a   
OL,13, moustachioed PI living the high-life in
OL,14, Hawaii and a quartet of Vietnam War    
OL,15, survivors who were on the run for a    
OL,16, crime they didn't commit.              
OL,18, Oh, did I also mention a hi-tech       
OL,19, motorbike, a hi-tech car and an hi-tech
OL,20, helicopter?

OL,6, On the gameshow front us Brits nicked a
OL,7, few formats off our American cousins   
OL,8, such as Family Fortunes and            
OL,9, Blockbusters (both of which at one     
OL,10, point were hosted by people named Bob) 
OL,11, but we also had our own brilliant shows
OL,12, such as Treasure Hunt which introduced 
OL,13, us to the beauty of the British        
OL,14, countryside and ... well, something    
OL,15, else the cameraman was always so keen  
OL,16, to focus on!                           
OL,18, Soaps were also on the rise during the 
OL,19, 1980's. The three legendary soaps of   
OL,20, Eastenders, Coronation Street and      
OL,21, Emmerdale Farm were still going strong 
OL,22, but the Australians also wanted a part 
OL,23, in this as well.

OL,6, This invariably started when the       
OL,7, various ITV regions discovered old     
OL,8, episodes of a 1970's show called The   
OL,9, Young Doctors. By the time us Brits got
OL,10, to watch the 1976 episodes it was just 
OL,11, one year away from being cancelled in  
OL,12, Oz after being on their screens for    
OL,13, almost a decade! Following this we got 
OL,14, Sons and Daughters, Neighbours and then
OL,15, Home and Away! Oh what a joy!          
OL,17, Dramas also made up a part of 1980's   
OL,18, TV. From light-hearted harbour-based   
OL,19, show Howards' Way to gruff Glaswegian  
OL,20, cop Taggart we had it all.

OL,6, In the midst of all this we had period 
OL,7, dramas such as The Thorn Birds and     
OL,8, Tenko. Those damn Aussie s also wanted 
OL,9, a piece of the action too with Return  
OL,10, To Eden!                               
OL,12, Technology also played a vital role in 
OL,13, British TV during the decade as        
OL,14, advancements in computer graphics gave 
OL,15, us a new spinning BBC globe, a flashy  
OL,16, logo for Channel 4 and the equally     
OL,17, colourful Central logo which, like its 
OL,18, C4 counterpart had a habit of          
OL,19, splintering and subsequently           
OL,20, reassembling itself again moments      
OL,21, later!

OL,6, To end this piece I will leave on one  
OL,7, memory of mine in the 1980's. I knew it
OL,8, was time for my younger self to get up 
OL,9, to bed at around 8pm and as soon as I  
OL,10, saw World In Action's 'Vitruvian Man'  
OL,11, light up on screen I knew it time for
